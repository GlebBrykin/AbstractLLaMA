# Dataset preparation and Tokenizer training (Gleb S. Brykin)
Open ipynb in Kaggle (you should use an environment without a GPU) and execute all the code cells sequentially.
As a result, the arXiv.bin and tok2048.model files will be created. arXiv.bin is a pre-tokenized dataset for LLM training and
tok2048.model is a trained tokenizer for inference. Download these files.
