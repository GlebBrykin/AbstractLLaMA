Computational complexity of the quantum separability problem<sep>The quantum separability problem asks if there exists a quantum computation that solves the same problem as the classical separability problem. In this work, we show that the problem is NP-complete for all integers $d geq 1$ and $d geq 2$ when the input alphabet is restricted to be a finite alphabet.
Beyond i.i.d. in Quantum Information Theory<sep>We introduce a new family of quantum information measures, called quantum-information-theoretic quantities, in which the measurements are subject to quantum measurement flipping. We establish a fundamental connection between quantum-information-theoretic quantities and their Bures diagonalizable measures, and we prove that the Bures diagonalizable measures are the quantum-information-theoretic quantities that are Borel measures. We then discuss the implications of this connection to information-theoretic measures, quantum channels, and quantum-mechanical problems.
On the Role of Shared Entanglement<sep>Shared entanglement is a property of quantum systems that can be used to distill quantum states into a short set of qubits. We study the role of shared entanglement in the context of two-qubit quantum systems, and show that it is critical to optimize the role of shared entanglement in the context of quantum state discrimination. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum state to be shared entanglement. We then show that the existence of a shared entanglement can be guaranteed if the system is sufficiently shared. We provide general conditions for a quantum system to be shared entanglement. We finally show that shared entanglement can be easily implemented in quantum systems using shared entanglement.
Quantum Versus Classical Proofs and Advice<sep>Designing quantum computers requires a strong and precise ability to verify the correctness of algorithms and to give feedback when failures occur in the real world. The verification of algorithms is a core part of the quantum experience, but it has been recently shown that verification is harder than classical. In this work, we show that quantum computers are not a good fit for verifying algorithms. We show that quantum computers cannot provide a rigorous verification method for algorithms that use classical information. Instead, they can provide a method to verify algorithms that use classical information. This paper shows that quantum computers can also provide a rigorous verification method for algorithms that use classical information.
Clifford Code Constructions of Operator Quantum Error Correcting Codes<sep>An operator quantum error correcting code (OQCC) is a quantum error correcting code that can correct quantum errors with a small number of qubits. The development of OQCCs can be extended to higher dimensions, which can be of multiple forms. In this work, we present a method for constructing OQCCs that are close to the GHZ-statistics, and have minimal number of quantum gates. We use the method to construct OQCCs for the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the qubit Heisenberg model. We also prove that the OQCCs are close to the GHZ-statistics, and thus we can construct OQCCs for the Heisenberg model.
Strongly Universal Quantum Turing Machines and Invariance of Kolmogorov Complexity<sep>We prove that the circuit complexity of the Bell-Ebrdin conjecture is $ Theta(2^{n})$, and in fact $ Theta(2^{n})$, thereby resolving the conjecture of Levin. The proof is based on a new approach to the study of the Kolmogorov complexity of quantum states.
Invertible Quantum Operations and Perfect Encryption of Quantum States<sep>We study the problem of invertibility of quantum states, which is the problem of inverting a quantum circuit by inverting a quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of inverting a quantum circuit. It is well-known that this problem can be solved by a quantum circuit of depth $2n$ and a classical lower bound $ Omega(n)$, where $n$ is the number of qubits. This classized upper bound is almost optimal, and the quantum lower bound $ Omega(n)$ is known to be tight. We also show that the inverting problem can be solved by a quantum operation of $O(n)$ depth.
Quantum Information and Entropy<sep>We prove that the entropy of a quantum state is equal to the entropy of a quantum state, and we prove that the entropy of a quantum state is equal to the entropy of a finite-dimensional state. We also show that the entropy of a quantum state is equal to the entropy of a finite-dimensional state that is equal to the entropy of a finite-dimensional state. We also show that the entropy of a finite-dimensional state is equal to the entropy of a finite-dimensional state that is equal to a finite-dimensional state. Finally, we prove that the entropy of a finite-dimensional state is equal to the entropy of a finite-dimensional state.
Using quantum oblivious transfer to cheat sensitive quantum bit commitment<sep>We propose a method to cheat a quantum computer based on quantum oblivious transfer. We consider the case where the quantum computer has access to a quantum device, a quantum noiseless communication channel, and the untrusted part of the quantum computer. We consider a scenario where the quantum computer has access to a quantum device, and the quantum device itself is oblivious, i.e., it is oblivious, i.e., the computer can not learn the input value of the quantum device. We propose a method to cheat the quantum computer, and show that the cheat-sensitive case is equivalent to the classical case, and that the classical machine learning problem is equivalent to the classical machine learning problem. We also show that quantum machine learning is equivalent to classical machine learning, and that the classical machine learning problem can be equivalently cast as a classical machine learning problem.
The BQP-hardness of approximating the Jones Polynomial<sep>In this note we show that the BQP-hardness of approximating the Jones polynomial of degree 2 functions cannot be proven in the quantum query model.
Maximally Non-Local and Monogamous Quantum Correlations<sep>We study the problem of anonymously quantum local non-local and monogamous correlations. We show that the anonymous quantum correlations can be used to construct a quantum version of the correlations, and that the anonymous local corrections can be used to construct a non-local correlation.
Classical simulators of quantum computers and no-go theorems<sep>We present a new classical algorithm for simulating the dynamics of quantum computers and no-go theorems. The algorithm is based on the classical Anshele-Schroeding method and uses the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to solve the underlying games. The quantum anshele is an application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to the Non-Equilibrium State Space Model (NESSM) of the Coulomb interaction. The Quantum Anshele is a quantum algorithm that can be used to simulate the dynamics of the NESSM. The algorithm works by solving a set of non-local operations, one for each vertex, which are then simulated by a quantum computer. The simulator is efficient for the NESSM model with a large number of input states, which is a major challenge in quantum computing. We demonstrate the efficiency of the simulator for a variety of non-equilibrium steady states. The simulator has a quantum advantage over the classical simulator, and the simulator is capable of simulating the NESSM dynamics with a much smaller number of input states.
Full security of quantum key distribution from no-signaling constraints<sep>Quantum key distribution (QK) is a new paradigm that allows a user to establish a shared secret key between two distant parties. This paper provides a formal definition of the no-signaling constraint, which deals with the security of QK. We define a no-signaling constraint and show that it is a necessary condition for QK to be secure. We also show that the no-signaling constraint is not necessary for QK to be secure. We then propose a construction of a no-signaling constraint, which is secure against any node attacker with no quantum leakage. We also show that the number of secrets required for QK to be secure is bounded. Finally, we present a construction of no-signaling constellations that is secure against any attacker with no quantum leakage but no quantum leakage.
Exponential Separation of Quantum and Classical Online Space Complexity<sep>We study the space complexity of learning a quantum state whose transition probability is a polynomial function of the state's size. We show that for a fixed class of polynomials, the space complexity is strictly larger than the time complexity of classical Boolean satisfiability. This implies that the space complexity of learning quantum states is strictly larger than the time complexity of learning quantum states. This is achieved by showing that the space complexity of learning quantum states is strictly larger than the space complexity of learning (the state's transition probability) by constructing a family of quantum states with unitary operators. Our construction is based on the classical Schr "{o}dinger equation, but the quantum Schr "{o}dinger equation is derived from the classical Schr "{o}dinger equation. This gives a number of insights into the space complexity of learning quantum states.
On the quantum analogue of Galileo's leaning tower experiment<sep>We give an explicit formula for a quantum analogue of the Galileo's lean tower experiment. This formula is analogous to the Galileo's lean tower experiment, which has been introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 224502 (2009). The lean tower experiment is a quantum phase transition, which is a universal phase transition in the law of entanglement. This phenomenon is a quantum analogue of the quantum Galileo experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 244502 (2009)]. We use this result to show that the quantum Galileo experiment is a universal quantum analogue of the Galileo's experiment.
`Plausibilities of plausibilities': an approach through circumstances<sep>Planning for a given environment is a difficult task, often requiring planning algorithms that are able to find the optimal path. We present a new method, `Plausibilistic Planning with Search (PPS),' where a planner is a way for the robot to find the optimal path by splitting the graph into two parts and using a circumnarity-based technique to select the optimal path. The circumnarity-based technique is used to find the optimal path, and the planning algorithm is used to select the optimal path. The planning algorithm is evaluated in a simulation and a real-world experiment, where we show that the proposed method is able to find the optimal path in a real-world environment.
The one-way communication complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching Problem<sep>We consider the computational complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching Problem in the context of the following two-party communication complexity games: the one-way communication game, where Alice and Bob communicate with Bob over a shared binary channel. We show that the problem of deciding whether a given input bitstrace is in the language of a Boolean Hidden Matching is polynomial-time solvable if Bob can prove that Alice cannot compute. We also prove that the one-way communication complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching problem is polynomial-time solvable if Alice and Bob can communicate over a shared bitstrace, and that it is NP-complete if Bob cannot communicate over a shared bitstrace. We also show that the one-way communication complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching problem is polynomial-time solvable if Bob cannot compute Alice's answers.
Exponential Separation of Quantum and Classical One-Way Communication Complexity for a Boolean Function<sep>We study the one-way communication complexity of Boolean functions on $n$ bits. We show that the problem is at least as hard as the well-separatedness problem for Boolean functions. We also prove that the task of computing the minimum-size quantum state that accepts one one-way Boolean function on $n$ bits is as hard as computing the minimum-size quantum state that accepts one one-way Boolean functions on $n$ bits. This hardness result is a consequence of the existence of a Boolean function $f$ on $n$ bits that accepts one-way quantum states on $n$ bits. We also show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a Boolean function accepts one one on $n$ bits.
Search via Quantum Walk<sep>Classical walk search is a well-known search algorithm that is widely used in machine learning and data mining. However, the use of quantum walks in searching for answers to a given query is still open. We present a quantum algorithm for searching a target solution by quantum walk, where the search is performed by quantum walk on a quantum computer. We show that the algorithm can be applied to searching for a target with a given query, and our method can be used to find the target with a given query.
Secure Controlled Teleportation<sep>Secure teleportation is a technique used to obtain an incomplete vector field from a set of independent, but not necessarily identical, vectors, using a known vector-valued field. We propose a new approach to secure teleportation, in which the teleported field is encoded in a plain form using a linear transformation. In this approach, teleportation is performed using a linear transformation of the original vector field. The linear transformation is computed by solving a linear programming problem and the linear transformation is solved using a convex optimization algorithm. We present numerical results that show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Quantum Pattern Retrieval by Qubit Networks with Hebb Interactions<sep>We introduce a quantum version of pattern retrieval problem, called quantum pattern retrieval, in which a quantum system sends a quantum state to another. The goal is to find a high-quality candidate set for the system to read by a noisy quantum state. We study the computational complexity of this problem, and prove that it is NP-hard. We also prove that the problem is NP-hard when the state is binary, even if the system is restricted to a single qubit.
On the Impossibility of a Quantum Sieve Algorithm for Graph Isomorphism<sep>We show that the quantum sieve for graph isomorphism is NP-complete.
Group Theoretical Formulation of Quantum Partial Search Algorithm<sep>In this paper, we introduce a new quantum partial search algorithm, called the quantum partial search algorithm (QPSA). The QPSA is a quantum algorithm that is designed to be able to find a better solution qubits in a quantum machine. The quantum partial search algorithm (QPSA) is a quantum algorithm that is designed to search for a better solution qubit by using a quantum feature. We use the quantum feature to select a good solution qubit for a given problem. The QPSA is a quantum annealing algorithm that is based on an optimal solution found by the quantum annealing algorithm. The QPSA is a quantum algorithm that can be used to find a better solution qubit in a quantum machine. We also introduce a new problem that is called quantum partial search problem (QPSPSPSPSPSPSPSSSB). The QPSA is a quantum algorithm that iterates between the quantum feature and the global search algorithm (GSA) and can find the optimal solution qubit in a quantum machine. We show that the QPSA can find a better solution qubit in a quantum machine. We also compare the quantum partial search algorithm (QPSA) with the quantum partial search algorithm (QPSA) and observe that the QPSA can find better solutions than the quantum partial search algorithm (QPSA).
Ergodic Classical-Quantum Channels: Structure and Coding Theorems<sep>The ergodic classical-quantum channel is studied. It is proved that the ergodic capacity is the same as that of the channel with classical input.
Subsystem Codes<sep>Subsystems of the finite type $y^{(n)}$ of a linear subsystem $y^{(n)}$ form a finite subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$. The subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$ is the subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$. Subsystem codes are subsystems of linear codes over the finite field $ mathbb{F}_q$. The subsystems of a linear subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$ form a finite subsystem $ mathcal{F}_q[x,y]/ langle x,y rangle = ell + ell + ell+1-eliminations}$. In this paper, we first derive the conditions under which subsystems of a linear subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$ form a finite subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$. Then, we develop a theory of subsystem subsystems, which generalizes the theory of subsystems of linear subsystems. In particular, we show that the subsystems form a finite subsystem $ mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ for any $n geq 2$, and we derive an algebraic characterization of the subsystem subsystems. In addition, we derive an algebraic characterization for subsystems of a linear subsystem $ mathcal{F} = mathcal{F} + ell$.
Quantum List Decoding of Classical Block Codes of Polynomially Small Rate from Quantumly Corrupted Codewords<sep>We introduce a new quantum list decoding algorithm for classical blind quantum block codes. The decoding algorithm is based on a quantum List Decoding algorithm and uses a quantum circuit to implement a quantum list of codewords. In the quantum List Decoding algorithm, the codeword is encoded by a quantum circuit that can be decoded using a classical List Decoder. Repeating this procedure with the use of a quantum circuit, we prove that the quantum List Decoder can be used to decode the classical codeword successfully and with a quantum speedup to the decoding algorithm. We also prove that the quantum List Decoder can be used to decode the classical code with a quantum linearly square error detector, which is a class of codes for which the decoding algorithm is corrected with a polynomially small probability. We believe that this new quantum List Decoding algorithm can be used to decode the classical code of classical linear block codes with a polynomially small error, and to prove that the quantum List Decoder can be used to decode the classical code with a polynomially small error.
Merlin-Arthur Games and Stoquastic Complexity<sep>We investigate the complexity of the StoqWarnin-Arthur Problem (SWAP) as a stochastic process, and its stochastic variant. SWAP is a fundamental belief propagation algorithm for approximate inference in probabilistic reasoning. We show that the SWAP algorithm is optimal in the trivial case, and give a tight lower bound on the expected runtime of the SWAP algorithm. We then show that the SWAP algorithm is optimal in the stochastic case. We also show that SWAP is optimal for stochastic versions of the SWAP problem.
Approximate Randomization of Quantum States With Fewer Bits of Key<sep>We show that the problem of approximately killing a single bit of a quantum state with a given probability of error can be solved by a classical algorithm with a fewer number of bits of quantum memory. Our approach is based on the idea of a "pseudo-random" algorithm which is a variant of the idea of pseudo-random generators for quantum states. We show that the classical pseudo-random generators for the quantum states of this classical algorithm can be used to generate an approximate killing of the original state. This allows us to obtain a classical algorithm with a fewer number of bits of quantum memory for the same task. We also show that the pseudo-random generator of the classical algorithm can be used to generate approximately killing of quantum states.
Continuous Variable Quantum Cryptography using Two-Way Quantum Communication<sep>Continuous variable-quantum-communication (CVQC) is a promising quantum information technology. This paper proposes a novel quantum algorithm for CVQC that can be implemented using two-way quantum communication. The proposed quantum algorithm is based on the quantum walk algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm for solving the Dijkstroit map. There are two main contributions in this work. First, we propose a novel quantum algorithm that is based on the quantum walk algorithm and the quantum walk algorithm. Second, we propose a novel quantum cryptography algorithm for quantum cryptography, which are based on a quantum walk algorithm. Since the proposed algorithm is quantum, it can be implemented on no quantum hardware. Next, we propose a quantum cryptography algorithm based on the quantum walk algorithm. The proposed quantum algorithms are implemented using two-way quantum-communication primitives, namely quantum 1-$k$ for $k=2, 3, 5$ for $k geq 2$, and quantum $k$ for $k=2, 3$ for $k geq 2$. Our quantum algorithms are based on 1-$k$ AND and OR operations. We have also developed a quantum version of Dijkstroic secret sharing scheme. Finally, we have used the proposed quantum algorithms for quantum key distribution.
Toward a general theory of quantum games<sep>The quantum game theory is a mathematical framework for studying complex quantum games, which represents a class of games in which players are allowed to use quantum information. It is a fundamental tool to study the properties of quantum games, including the existence of an effective equilibrium and the existence of a coordinated equilibrium. The existence of a coordinated equilibrium is a consequence of the existence of a quantum game in which players are allowed to use quantum quantum states. In this paper, we study the existence of a quantum game in a general quantum game. We show that if a quantum game is uniquely defined, then the existence of a quantum game is the same as the existence of a quantum game. We also discuss the existence of a unique equilibrium and the existence of a unique equilibrium.
A Tight High-Order Entropic Quantum Uncertainty Relation With Applications<sep>We introduce a novel entropic quantum uncertainty relation based on the entropic formulation of entropic quantum variations of Shannon entropy. This relation is intimately connected with the entropic formulation of quantum measurements and with the entropic formulation of quantum entropic quantum variations. We show that the entropic quantum variations of Shannon entropy and entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropy are the same in terms of the entropic quantum variations of Shannon entropy and the entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic random variables. We also show that the entropic quantum variation of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum variations of Renyi entropic quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum (multi-qubit Gaussian (MQG) games. We also propose a novel class of quantum reinforcement learning algorithms for MQ games whose rewards are non-stationary, and in which the quantum model can be trained to be efficient.
Deciding whether a quantum state has secret correlations is an NP-complete problem<sep>We provide a proof of the NP-completeness of the decidability problem for an exponential family of quantum states. We prove that a family of quantum states has secret correlations and an exponential family of quantum states with secret correlations. In particular, we prove that the Shannon entropy of the binary symmetric channel is 0 if and only if the Shannon entropy of the binary symmetric channel is 0 if and only if the binary symmetric channel has secret correlations.
How a Clebsch-Gordan Transform Helps to Solve the Heisenberg Hidden Subgroup Problem<sep>We study the Heisenberg Hamming distance problem, which asks whether a given matrix $A$ contains a subgroup of a given size with a given Hamming distance. We show that the problem is NP-complete even when $A$ is a tree or a grid. We also show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time when $A$ is a tree, at most twice the number of subgroups in $A$.
A father protocol for quantum broadcast channels<sep>We propose a father protocol for quantum broadcast channels. The protocol is based on a flat protocol proposed by Izhorima and Radhakrisha--Radhakrisha--Rybey protocol. We show that the protocol is secure and can be implemented in a realistic environment.
Lineal: A linear-algebraic Lambda-calculus<sep>Leal is a functional language that extends the linear-algebraic programming capabilities of the functional language of the functional programming language SLATES. Let $u$ and $v$ be given functions which are invariant under the action of $u$. Let $u$ be another programming language over $u$. In this note, we give a concise presentation of the lambda-calculus.
Quantum Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes<sep>Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are a promising candidate for near-term quantum error-correcting codes. However, the maximum cardinality of a QECC is not known in general, and the minimum distance of QECCs is not known. In this paper, we demonstrate that a QECC can be designed based on a generalized QECC structure. The proposed QECCs are constructed by using the classical entanglement of QECCs and the quantum repeat distance. The minimum distance of QECCs is close to the minimum distance of the quantum repeat distance. The minimum distance of QECCs is also close to the minimum distance of the quantum repeat distance. The minimum distance of QECCs can be further reduced by applying a certain fixed-rate quantum repeat-accumulation protocol. As a by-product, we also present the quantum repeat-accumulation protocol for QECCs.
Quantum Convolutional Codes Derived From Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller Codes<sep>A convolutional code is a set of nodes interconnected by a quantum superposition of different types of nodes. Quantum convolutional codes have been proposed to achieve the information-theoretic limits of communication over classical memory channels. In this paper, we propose a new type of convolutional codes that is derived from Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes. We also introduce a new type of convolutional codes derived from Reed-Solomon and Reed-Solomon codes. We show that the proposed codes have the same parameters as the quantum counterparts, namely, the minimum distance and the minimum distance.
A presentation of Quantum Logic based on an "and then" connective<sep>The present article introduces the concept of "and then" connective as a form of quantum logic. It is shown that the logic of any two Boolean formulae are the same in general, and the logic of "and not in isolation" connective is a form of quantum logic. It is proved that the logic of any two connective is a quantum logic. The logic of any two connective is a quantum logic of any Boolean formulae, and it is shown that the logic of any two connective is a quantum logic of any Boolean formulae.

Turning the Liar paradox into a metatheorem of Basic logic<sep>We introduce a logic for reasoning about the Liar paradox, which is a new form of 'logic of binding forces'. The logic is based on Boolean algebras and is made up of a variety of logical operators, including, for example, restriction, inversion, and revision. The logic has been shown to be a powerful tool for reasoning about the behaviour of many real-world complex systems. The logic can be used to reason about the behaviour of the Liar paradox, as well as to reason about the satisfaction of the logic with respect to a given model. We provide a formal proof of the turning of the paradox into a metatheorem of Boolean algebras, and show how the logic can be used to reason about the behaviour of a model of the Liar paradox.
A decoupling approach to the quantum capacity<sep>We revisit the classical capacity defined by Aaronson and Ambainis in 1980 and prove that the classical capacity is a necessary condition for the quantum capacity to be a necessary condition for the existence of an infinite classical channel. We also show that the classical capacity is the same as the quantum capacity of a quantum channel, in the sense that can be described by a quantum channel.
Markovian Entanglement Networks<sep>We study the problem of computing markov entanglement in a graph $G$ with a given graph $H$. We show that the problem is NP-hard, but that it becomes tractable under a natural restriction on the graph $H$ and the arrival order of edges. We then show that the problem is NP-hard under the restriction on the arrival order. Further, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem which runs in polynomial time and is NP-hard under the restriction on the arrival order of edges.
Quantum Key Distribution with Classical Bob<sep>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a key encapsulated into a multiterminal network, where the entanglement distribution between the sender and the receiver is assumed to be a quantum channel. However, in practice, one wants to transmit a message onto a receiver, which is not only dependent on the message itself but also on the message itself. This requires a certain amount of quantum resources, which are not readily available in the classical case. In this paper, we develop a framework for the implementation of QKD with classical senders, and show how to use it to transmit a message on a classical channel. The approach is based on the observation that the classical sender can use a quantum channel if and only if the quantum channel is a quantum channel. We demonstrate the application of this approach in the context of key distribution with quantum senders, and investigate the impact of the number of qubits and the number of qubits on key rates.
Graphs, Quadratic Forms, and Quantum Codes<sep>We present a structure of quadratic forms and quantum codes, and show that they are quantum codes. We also give a bound on the minimum distance of these codes, and we give a lower bound on the minimum distance of these codes. We then present a quantum algorithm for decoding quantum codes, and we give a bound on the minimum distance of these codes. We also present an example of a quantum code with circuit complexity $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the code.
Quantum Convolutional BCH Codes<sep>Quantum convolutional codes (QCCs) are one of the most interesting classes of codes with applications in distributed storage and data transmission. In this paper, we propose a new family of QCCs called QCC-QCCs, which are QCCs with the property that the convolution of the quantum convolution of the QCCs is a quantum version of the convolution of the quantum convolutional codes. They are called QCC-QCCs. We provide a complete set of generator sets of QCC-QCCs, and we give a few examples of QCC-QCCs. We also study the parameters of QCC-QCCs and give some examples of QCC-QCCs.
Semidefinite programming characterization and spectral adversary method for quantum complexity with noncommuting unitary queries<sep>We present a new approach to quantum complexity that combines the semidefinite programming (SDP) approach with the SDP method for convex optimization. The proposed approach relies on the notion of the SDP-induced Hamiltonian to characterize polynomial-time quantum algorithms. We show that the SDP approach provides a natural generalization of the classical SDP approach to quantum complexity and provide a new and intuitive complexity measure for quantum algorithms. We also provide a quantum adversary method for quantum algorithms with noncommunication complexity $O( log n)$. We then show that the SDP-induced Hamiltonian can be used to define a "linear-time quantum adversary" algorithm for quantum algorithms with $O( log n)$-depth quantum circuits. We next prove the $ Omega( log n)$ lower bound for the quantum query complexity of solving a classical optimization problem given by the SDP-induced Hamiltonian. Finally, we show that the quantum query complexity of solving a classical optimization problem is $ Theta( log n)$.
Quantum Block and Convolutional Codes from Self-orthogonal Product Codes<sep>We study the problem of constructing quantum block and convolutional codes from self-orthogonal codes. We show that the constructed codes can be used to construct quantum codes with good parameters.
Constructions of Quantum Convolutional Codes<sep>A new class of quantum convolutional codes is constructed. We prove that, for a given convolutional code, there is an optimal length of a minimal code of dimension $n$. The construction is based on the construction of a new family of convolutional codes, which is shown to be optimal. For the case of the Bonelighttivishes the concept of a convolutional code, the constructed codes are shown to be maximum distance separable and have the largest minimum distance.
Classical Interaction Cannot Replace a Quantum Message<sep>We prove that the classical interaction between two quantum parties can be replaced by a quantum message. We also show that the replacement of an interaction between two quantum parties can be performed using a classical message.
Is Quantum Bit Commitment Really Possible?<sep>In quantum cryptography, a public-key is sent via a quantum channel if it is possible to decode the channel output from the channel output. Such a scheme is known as quantum bit commitment (QBC) in the sense that the secret-key-distribution (SKD) trade-off is fully achieved by the encoding and decoding the secret-key-distribution (SKD) pair. In this paper, we study the security of QBC for the case of SKD pairs, where the SKD pair is a quantum channel with one-way functional qubits. We first show that a quantum bit commitment scheme (QBC) can be easily constructed from a certain quantum channel model, and then show that the SKD pair has no quantum advantage over the SKD. In particular, we show that the QBC is secure against quantum bit commitment (QBC) even if the SKD pair is a tripartite graph. Our main result is to show that the SKD pair can be constructed from a quantum bit commitment (QBC) scheme. We then show that the QBC scheme is secure against quantum bit commitment (QBC) even if the SKD pair is a tripartite graph. We then show that for a specific class of quantum bit commitment (QBC), the QBC-based QBC scheme is secure against quantum quantum bit commitment (QBC-QBC) and the QBC-QBC-QBC-QBC-QBC scheme is secure against quantum quantum bit commitment (QBC-QBC-QBC). Our results provide the first comprehensive security analysis for QBC-QBC.
A decision procedure for unitary linear quantum cellular automata<sep>The question of whether or not a given unitary linearized map is unitary linearly independent of the initial state of a quantum cellular automaton is a central question in quantum information theory. We present a decision procedure for unitary linearized quantum cellular automata. We also present a procedure for constructing a unitary linearized map that is unitary on a unitary L*a equivalent to the initial state of the cellular automaton.
A Quantum Algorithm for Finding the Minimum<sep>We propose a quantum algorithm for finding the min-plus-matrix product of two matrices. The algorithm is based on the quantum walk approach, which is known to find the correlation of a matrix in a quantum computer when the number of qubits is fixed. The algorithm is based on the quantum walk approach, which is known to be effective for finding the minimum of a quadratic form over a finite field. The algorithm is based on the idea of the quantum walk, and is shown to be able to find the minimum of a quadratic form over a finite field. We also show that the algorithm has the same complexity as the quantum algorithm but can be used to find the minimum of a quadratic function over a finite field.
Insecurity of Quantum Secure Computations<sep>Quantum computers are envisioned to revolutionize the way we work. They are being used to solve problems in the design of cryptographic schemes. In this context, quantum computers are a powerful tool to solve problems in the real world, but they are also a valuable resource for the design of quantum algorithms. They are also used to study the security of quantum algorithms, in particular the security of quantum computers. However, the security of quantum algorithms is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a model for the security analysis of quantum computers, in terms of the security of quantum computation. We first define the security of quantum computation and then discuss the security of quantum computation. We then show the security of quantum computation by examining the security of quantum computers. Finally, we propose quantum computing algorithms that are secure against quantum computing, and we show that quantum computing algorithms are vulnerable to quantum attacks.
Reversible Simulation of Irreversible Computation by Pebble Games<sep>The pebble game is a classic model of computing in which two players can move in a pebble style. In this paper we study the reversibility of computation by pebble games. We show that the reversible pebble game is equivalent to the reversible pebble game. We then show that the reversible pebble game is equivalent to the reversible pebble game. We use the reversible pebble game to show that the reversible pebble game is equivalent to the reversible pebble game.
Reversibility and Adiabatic Computation: Trading Time and Space for Energy<sep>In the past decades, the use of digital signal processing has spurred the development of applications that are inherently resilient to noise and unpredictable disturbances. In this context, reversibility is a fundamental property of computations that has been largely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reversibility that is applicable to any signal processing algorithm that can be used to perform reversible computation. Our approach is based on the fundamental idea of reversibility, which involves the change of the signal structure after a certain time interval. Our approach is inspired by the reversible approach, where reversibility is applied to the signal before the computation. The reversibility is also used to reduce the computational complexity, thus reducing the computational complexity. The proposed reversible approach is able to reversibly compute an arbitrary signal before it is processed, and thus, reversible computation is applicable to any signal processing algorithm. We show that the proposed reversible approach can achieve almost the same computational complexity as the original reversible computation, while providing similar reversibility levels. Finally, we show that the proposed reversible approach can be used to reduce the computational energy of a signal processing algorithm.
"Minus c" Symmetry in Classical and Quantum Theories<sep>We present a new method for constructing a symmetry breaking the idea that a quantum theory is a symmetry breaking of "minus cardona". Introducing a new notion of "minus cardona", we show that a classical or quantum theory is a classical model with a "minus cardin" symmetry. In contrast, quantum and classical models are the same: the classical and quantum ones are the same in both cases. We also show that the same concept is applicable to the much more general case of classical and quantum theories.
Computing Local Invariants of Qubit Systems<sep>We study the problem of computing local invariants of quit systems where each qubit is described by a finite number of qubits. We show that the problem of computing local invariants is $ mathbf{NP}$-complete, and we present an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal local invariants. We also show that the problem of computing a local invariant of quit systems is $ mathbf{NP}$-complete. We also show that the problem of computing a local invariant of quit systems is $ mathbf{NP}$-complete, and we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the optimal local invariants of quit systems.
Analogue Quantum Computers for Data Analysis<sep>Quantum computing is a promising approach towards problems of quantum computing that can be accomplished by quantum computers. In this paper, we present a quantum analogue of the classical data analysis framework, called analogue quantum algorithms, that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as the analysis of spin Hall phases, the simulation of the spin Hall phase, the analysis of the spin Hall phase, and the analysis of the spin Hall phase. The framework is based on the combination of analogue quantum computing and quantum differential cryptanalysis. We present an implementation of analogue quantum algorithms in a 3-qubit Crab fluid, and show that they can be used to solve problems that are harder to solve using classical computers compared to the classical algorithm.
Quantum Lower Bounds by Polynomials<sep>We study the complexity of the quantum query complexity of computing a sum of $k$ independent polynomials of degree $d$, $k geq 2$, of the form $f(x,y)= max {x,y }$, where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d$. We show that the class $ mathrm{QCMA}$, which is the class of quantum polynomial-space computation problems, can be solved in polynomial time using a quantum algorithm with $ mathrm{QCMA}$ query complexity of $ mathrm{QCMA}_ epsilon$, where $ mathrm{QCMA}_ epsilon$ is the quantum query complexity of $ mathrm{QCMA}$. We also show that $ mathrm{QCMA}_ epsilon leq mathrm{QCMA}$ and $ mathrm{QCMA}$ are equivalent, implying that the quantum query complexity of $ mathrm{QCMA}$ is equal to $ mathrm{QCMA}$. We show that the class $ mathrm{QCMA}$, which is the quantum analog of the class $ mathrm{QCMA}$, is equal to $ mathrm{QCMA}$, implying that $ mathrm{QCMA}$ is equal to $ mathrm{QCMA}$. We also show that $ mathrm{QCMA}$ is equal to $ mathrm{QCMA}$, implying that it requires $ mathrm{QCMA}$ to have polynomially-sized quantum gadgets.
1-way quantum finite automata: strengths, weaknesses and generalizations<sep>In this paper, we introduce the 1-way quantum finite automata (1-1QFAs) and the 1-way quantum finite automata (1-1QFAs) as a generalization of classical finite automata (CFAs) and classical MSO-definable SAT-solvers. We show that the classes of 1-1QFAs and the 1-1QFAs are equivalent, and that the classes of 1QFAs and the 1-1QFAs are equivalent. These results are obtained by combining our main results with a new characterization of the complexity classes TENCEN TO, TENCEN TO, and TENCEM TO in terms of the complexity of the emptiness problem for both CFAs and 1QFAs.
Dense Quantum Coding and a Lower Bound for 1-way Quantum Automata<sep>We investigate the languages accepted by an automaton with a quantum channel. A quantum channel is defined by a sequence of quantum states, each of which is mapped to a set of input states. A quantum channel is defined by a finite set of input states, and one can use quantum states to represent the same set of input states. For each of these languages, we determine the minimum number of quantum states required for a quantum channel to be mapped to another. We also show that the minimum number of quantum states required for a quantum channel to be mapped to another is the same. As a corollary, we show that the minimum number of quantum states required for a quantum channel to be mapped to another is the same. The minimum number of quantum states required for an automaton accepting 1-way quantum automata is the same as the minimum number of quantum states needed for a quantum automaton accepting 1-way quantum automata. We also show that the minimum number of quantum states required for a given automaton accepting 1-way quantum automata is the same as the number of quantum states required for a given automaton.
The quantum query complexity of approximating the median and related statistics<sep>We study the quantum query complexity of computing the median of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that the quantum query complexity of computing a median of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $n^{ Theta(d)}$, while the quantum query complexity of computing the median of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $n^{ Theta(d)}$. Our results also imply that the quantum query complexity of computing the median is $n^{ Theta(d)}$ for any $d ge 2$. We also show that the quantum query complexity of computing the median of median and relative median of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $n^{ Theta(d)}$. These results may be of interest in the design of efficient algorithms for various problems in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space.
Quantum Oracle Interrogation: Getting all information for almost half the price<sep>The work of Greenberg and Singh [GS17] is a quantum algorithm that performs the quantum computation in a classical oracle. In the classical oracle model, the quantum query complexity is $ tilde O( sqrt{n})$ and the quantum query complexity is $ tilde O(n)$. We present a new classical oracle that uses only classical oracles, where $n$ is the number of qubits. This class is inspired by the classical oracle QIA 2020. We show that the quantum oracle can be efficiently simulated by a classical oracle.
Two Classical Queries versus One Quantum Query<sep>We present a new approach to the problem of selecting a subset of database variables that satisfy a given set of constraints. This approach is based on the notion of a "topological quantum query" as defined in [Qiao, Sem. Par. T., and D. Rober. Comput. Sci., 1984]. In particular, for the case when database variables are positive and the query is to be determined, the topological quantum query is the most efficient way to find the set of all possible perturbations of the database variables. We show that the topological query is equivalent to a one-dimensional Schr "odinger bridge over the database variables. We then show that if the topological query is a one-dimensional Schr "odinger bridge over the database variables, then we can determine the set of perturbations of the database variables that satisfy the given constraints.
Fast Quantum Fourier Transforms for a Class of Non-abelian Groups<sep>We present a fast quantum algorithm for computing the $N$-group families of $N times N$ non-abelian groups. The fastest known algorithm for this problem, which runs in $O(N^2)$ time, uses $O(N^2 log N)$ quantum resources. Our algorithm is based on the quantum Fourier transform and also works for a class of non-abelian groups.
An Introduction to Quantum Computing for Non-Physicists<sep>This paper presents a new class of quantum algorithms for solving non-physics problems. They are based on the quantum-classical hybridization of the classical, classical and quantum, classical, and quantum algorithms. The quantum algorithms are designed to solve a wide range of non-physical problems efficiently, including the unstable eigenvalue problem and the damped harmonic oscillator. The algorithms are implemented on a quantum computer, and the performance of the algorithms is assessed by comparing them with the classical counterparts. The algorithms are compared with the quantum algorithms on a set of non-physical problems. The quantum algorithms are also compared with the classical algorithms on the same problems, and the classical algorithms are compared with the quantum algorithms on a set of classical problems. The quantum algorithms are shown to be better for solving the classical problems than the classical algorithms.
Concatenating Decoherence Free Subspaces with Quantum Error Correcting Codes<sep>We present a method to construct a quantum error correcting code that corrects a linear combination of the quantum free subspaces of the code. Our construction is based on quantum error correcting codes with quantum error-correcting codes that are quantum error correcting codes. The construction is based on a new quantum error correcting code construction that we developed recently proposed by the authors. The construction is based on the quantum error correcting code proposed by Arino-Vyev and Evans. We also introduce a new quantum error correcting code construction that we call quantum ECC (QECC) that we call quantum ECC. We show that the construction is a quantum error correcting code with quantum error correcting code. We present extensive simulation results which demonstrate that the proposed construction outperforms previously known constructions.
Classical Trajectories for two Ring-Shaped Potentials<sep>An octave-like potential is a potential in the form of a complex number of octave points. The octave potential can be used to describe the behavior of a wide range of systems, from the dynamics of the fractional dynamics of a dipole to the dynamics of a real body. The octave potential is a fractional analog of the central radius, and is typically defined by the ratio of the angular frequency of a body to its fractional radius. In this paper, we propose to use a trajectory to define the octave radius in terms of the octave's octave radius. We use this trajectory to define the octave radius in terms of the octave radius, and show that it is equivalent to the radius of the fractional Hamiltonian. We then use this trajectory to define the octave potential in terms of an integral of the fractional Hamiltonian. We show that the octave radius is an analog of the Hamiltonian of the fractional Hamiltonian. We also show that the octave radius can be defined as the radius of the Hamiltonian of the fractional Hamiltonian. Finally, we show that the octave potential can be defined as the radius of the fractional Hamiltonian of the fractional Hamiltonian.
Coin Tossing is Strictly Weaker Than Bit Commitment<sep>We show that it is impossible to coin a strictly weaker thought experiment (without bit commitment) together with a single bit of advice that is not weaker than a strong (strictly weaker) thought experiment. We do this by showing that the coin operator of Schnorr is strictly weaker than the coin operator of a Bit Commitment.
Unconditionally Secure Bit Commitment<sep>We consider the problem of private state transfers in the context of Bit commitment, a cryptographic primitive that has been extensively studied in the past few years. The main challenge is to enable the generation of private public keys, which are then securely verified using public keys. We present RCKS, a novel protocol for private private key generation based on the replication of public keys. RCKS is a replication-based protocol, which allows the generation of private keys using public keys, and therefore can be used to generate private keys without the need for a trusted third party. We show that RCKS is secure, and can be used to generate private private keys, even when the state of the public keys is unknown.
Minimal coupling and Feynman's proof<sep>We prove that couplings of the coupled system of the equations of motion in a frame of reference are possible. The proof is based on the construction of the couplings in a frame of reference.
Lower Bounds for Quantum Search and Derandomization<sep>We show that a quantum algorithm for the unweighted quantum search problem (without the constraint) would have query complexity $n^{1-o(1)}$, and we obtain a lower bound of $ Omega(n^{2/3})$. Note that the lower bound holds for the unweighted quantum search problem, and we prove that for any unweighted quantum algorithm there is a quantum algorithm with query complexity $n^{1-o(1)}$ and answers correct (i.e., it returns a solution of size at most $n^{1-o(1)}$).
A Quick Glance at Quantum Cryptography<sep>Quantum cryptography is the use of techniques to protect secret information in quantum systems, which can be used to protect secret information in a quantum system. Since quantum cryptography is a classical protocol, it is important to consider the minimal amount of quantum resources in a system. In this work, we propose a quantum glance, a quantum key distribution protocol that is able to achieve high gear in a quantum system. We prove that the gear value of 3.202 is achievable for a 4-bit device.
A note on quantum black-box complexity of almost all Boolean functions<sep>We give a new, improved upper bound for quantum black-box complexity of Boolean functions with bounded $||C||_in$-distortion. We show that the quantum black-box complexity of ($||C||_{a-d}||C||_{pq}$) is at most $ Omega(||C||_{a-d}||C||_{pq})$ and $O(|||C||_{a-d}||C||)$, where $b$ is the bit complexity of the function and $d$ is the dimension of the input. Our bound is tight in the sense that for any $m$-Boolean function, the quantum black-box complexity is at most $ Omega(m sqrt{n})$ and the quantum query complexity is at least $ Omega(m sqrt{n})$.
Non-equal-time Poisson brackets<sep>The Poisson brackets are a fundamental tool in statistics and machine learning. We present a new method for computing the Poisson brackets for non-equal-time non-equal-time poisson brackets. Our method is based on a novel formulation of the Poisson brackets as bracketings. Integer linear algebraic methods allow us to compute the Poisson brackets for arbitrary non-equal-time poisson brackets. We also present a method to compute the Poisson brackets for arbitrary non-equal-time poisson brackets.
NQP_{C} = co-C_{=}P<sep>We define a class of polynomials $P$ with $C_{>0}$ and $C_{>0}$ as invariants of the polynomials $P$ and $C_{>0}$. We show that the polynomials $P$ satisfy the following conditions: $P$ is positive semidefinite, $P$ is positive semidefinite and $C_{>0}$ is non-negative. For $P$ and $C_{>0}$, we show that $P$ satisfies the condition if and only if $P$ and $C_{>0}$ are positive semidefinite, and $P$ and $C_{>0}$ are subchains of positive elements. We prove that the condition $P$ satisfies the condition if and only if $P$ is non-negative and $P$ is not positive semidefinite. Finally, we prove that the condition $P$ satisfies the condition if and only if $P$ is positive semidefinite.
Polynomial-Time Solution to the Hidden Subgroup Problem for a Class of non-abelian Groups<sep>In this paper we consider the problem of determining the hidden subgroups of a class of non-abelian groups. We show that the problem is in PTAS and we present an algorithm for this problem which is polynomial-time.
A better lower bound for quantum algorithms searching an ordered list<sep>The searching algorithm of Qi and Luo is a search algorithm that searches an ordered list of $n$ elements in $ {0,..., n }$ in time $O( log n/n)$. They give an algorithm that searches all the elements in $O(1)$ time per element in $O( log n/ log log n)$ time. In this paper we improve this time bound to $O( log n/ log log n/ log log n)$. Our improvement is obtained by a new reduction technique that we call the shifted reduction.
Quantum Bounded Query Complexity<sep>We show that, in the quantum setting, the quantum query complexity of computing the distance between two points in the unitary group of dimension $d$, is $O(d^{1.5})$. This improves the previous best bound of $O(d^2)$, which was given in (Beigel & Pudl 'ak, 2017). This improves the previous bound of $O(d^2)$, which was given in (Shpilka & Volkovis, 2019). Our result is based on a new bound on the quantum query complexity of evaluating a polynomial of the form $ exp( exp(-d^{1.5}))$ over the algebraic number-counting group. Our approach is based on a new quantum algebraic number-counting technique that may be of independent interest.
An Almost-Quadratic Lower Bound for Quantum Formula Size<sep>We show that the quantum $ textsc{Max}( varsecrontes, varsec.r.t.~functional varieties problem} [ textit{Forbes, DISC 2012}] can be solved in polynomial time. This improves upon the previous lower bound of $ textsf{P}$=$ textsf{poly}${}{} [ textsf{Forbes, DISC 2012}]. We also show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if the variable has fixed dimensions, and the variables may have arbitrary number of qubits.
A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything<sep>Life and everything is a scientific concept: the world itself, the right might be in the wake of. What does it mean? Is it possible to make a myth of the concept, and what does it mean to know about it,? What does it mean to know about it? What do we know about it? In this paper I present some basic concepts, I discuss some of the most important questions and how they can be answered in the same way. I argue that, in the context of life, I will be able to understand the meaning of a scientific concept, and some of the most important questions that I will answer about it. I will also discuss some of the main problems I have in the context of life, and will likewise be able to tell us what I know about the world.
Probabilities to accept languages by quantum finite automata<sep>We consider probabilistic quantum finite automata (PFAs) and quantum finite automata (QFAs), and their probabilistic extensions. We first show that the probability distributions of PFAs are exponentially large, and then we prove that the exponential probability distribution is asymptotic to the exponential probability distribution. We then provide an example of a PFA with a deterministic transition probability distribution, and show that the probability distributions of PFAs are asymptotically more probive than the one given by classical probabilistic automata. We also show that the probability distributions of QFAs are asymptotically more probive than that of classical probabilistic automata.
Average-Case Quantum Query Complexity<sep>We study the computational complexity of computing the average-case classical complexity of a function $f$ in the quantum randomized query model. We show that for any $ epsilon>0$, $ Omega( epsilon^{-1})$-query algorithms for $f$ can be performed in $ Omega(n)$ time. Our results hold for the randomized query model introduced by Cohen-Schapira-Strausz and Winter. Our main technical contribution is a novel application of the classical Szemer 'edi-Trojectott-Schapira-Shafranov-Schupp (STS) algorithm to the randomized query model. This result is obtained by exploiting the structure of the problem and showing that the problem is easier to solve.
A simple proof of the unconditional security of quantum key distribution<sep>The unconditional security of quantum key distribution is a fundamental requirement of quantum communication and cryptography. Recently, a number of quantum cryptographic protocols have been proposed, with the help of quantum oracles. In this work, we provide a general framework for the unconditional security of quantum key distribution based on a new quantum algorithm. The framework is based on a new quantum circuit called the quantum-authentic-simulation quantum-simulation circuit (QASIC). The QASIC uses a quantum-authentic authentication circuit to make the quantum circuit stable against quantum attacks. We show that the QASIC can be used to build a universal quantum-simulation classical-authentic (QS-CA) protocol for quantum key distribution based on the QASIC. In addition, we discuss the possible applications of QASIC to secure quantum-secure key distribution.
Optimal lower bounds for quantum automata and random access codes<sep>We show that the lower bounds on the minimum size of quantum automata that use only classical automata are essentially tight. We also show that the lower bounds on the minimum size of quantum automata are tight up to constant factors.
Self-Testing of Universal and Fault-Tolerant Sets of Quantum Gates<sep>We present a new algorithm for testing universal and fault-tolerant sets of univariate and multivariate quantum gates. The algorithm is based on the self-testing technique of Gabidulin codes. We show that any universal set of $N$ univariate and multivariate quantum gates can be tested by self-testing of $N$ univariate and multivariate quantum gates. This implies that any universal set of $N$ univariate and multivariate quantum gates can be tested by self-testing of $N$ univariate and multivariate quantum gates.
Quantum finite multitape automata<sep>We present a quantum finite multitape automata (QFMA) with a non-negative real number. QFMA is a generalization of finite multitape automata (FMA). We present a new technique for constructing a non-negative real number, and use it to construct a quantum single-shot quantum FMA. We give a construction of a non-negative real number such that the quantum multitape FMA is always realizable.
Operation of universal gates in a DXD superconducting solid state quantum computer<sep>Recently, a quantum computing device has been developed, which can be used to solve complex multi-qubit problems. Here, a superconducting quantum computer, with a circuit architecture and a quantum algorithm architecture, has been developed. The operation of the circuit is based on the superconducting magnetic field, which is a universal magnetic field. The operation of the circuit is based on the voltage-current effect, which is analogous to the voltage-current effect in the electronic spin glass. In this work, we have demonstrated the operation of a superconductive quantum computer, based on the operation of the operation of the circuit. The operation of the quantum device has been implemented in a superconductive quantum computer. The operation of the quantum device is based on the magnetic field, which is a magnetic field generated by the superconductive magnetic field. The operation of the operation of the circuit has been based on the magnetic field, which is a magnetic field generated by the operation of the circuit. The operation of the quantum circuit and the operation of the magnetic field enable the quantum computer to perform the operation of the operation of the quantum magnetic field. The operation of the operation of the magnetic field generated by the superconductive magnetic field has been discussed in this work. The operation of the magnetic field applied to the operation of the quantum magnetic field has been discussed in the form of the scalar potential of the superconductor. The operation of the magnetic field on the quantum device is performed by the voltage-count operator using the magnetic field generated by the operation of the magnetic field on the magnetic field. The operation of the magnetic field on the operation of the magnetic field on the quantum spin glass can be performed by the operation of the magnetic field on the operation of the magnetic field on the operation of the magnetic field on the operation of the magnetic field on the superconducting magnetic field.
A Foundation of Programming a Multi-Tape Quantum Turing machine<sep>We present a programming language for a multi-tape quantum Turing machine (MQTM), which is a multi-tape Turing Machine (MTTM) that is based on the concept of tape, which is a multi-tape Turing machine. The language has a non-deterministic tape, which is a set of tapes that are the same in all tapes. We show that the language is expressively equivalent to the latter one.
Secure Classical Bit Commitment using Fixed Capacity Communication Channels<sep>We propose a new communication protocol for secure classical bit commitment where the goal is to send a commitment to a receiver by revealing the commitment of a message sent to the receiver. We consider a scenario in which the receiver has a fixed capacity channel, and the receiver has a fixed capacity channel. The receiver receives a bit commitment and uses the received bit commitment to decode a commitment that is obtained from the channel. We prove that the capacity of the secure classical commitment protocol is $1/ sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of participants in the network. Moreover, we show that the capacity of the secure classical commitment protocol is $1/ sqrt{n}$. We also prove that the capacity of the secure classical commitment protocol is $1/ sqrt{n}$.
Structure behind Mechanics<sep>In this paper we investigate the structure of a mechanical system. We define a moving mesh and show that it is a hierarchical tree. We use the notion of a hierarchical tree to define a notion of a moving mesh. We show that the moving mesh is a subgraph of a hierarchical tree. We then use the notion of an hierarchical tree to define a moving mesh. We show that the moving mesh is a subgraph of a hierarchical tree. We show that the hierarchical tree is a subgraph of a hierarchical tree. We show that the hierarchical tree is a subgraph of a hierarchical tree. We use this observation to construct a moving mesh of the first level of the hierarchical tree.
The importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes<sep>The current digital body system (DBS) is considered to be a viable solution to the energy-efficient, scalable, and safe operation of the brain. However, DBSs are vulnerable to quantum darkening, which can be dangerous in the brain. This is due to the quantum nature of the DBS, which is characterized by the quantum wave function, which is a quantum singular value. In this work, we investigate the effect of quantum decoherence on the brain process, and show that quantum decoherence can be detected by quantum correlation. We then apply the quantum correlation to the brain process, and find that the quantum correlation can be used to detect quantum fluctuations. We find that the correlation between the quantum states is more sensitive to the decoherence than to the decoherence. Our results suggest that quantum correlation can be used to detect quantum fluctuations in brain processes.
Analysis of Quantum Functions<sep>Analysis of the quantum function has been proposed recently, but it is not clear how to choose the function for a given quantum program. The quantum function describes the quantum correlation of input and output qubits. In this paper, we present a new quantum correlation function that can be used for quantum correlation testing. We prove that this quantum correlation function is a quantum correlation function. We also present an algorithm that can be used to check whether a quantum correlation function is a quantum correlation function.
Quantum Computation and Quadratically Signed Weight Enumerators<sep>This paper focuses on the problem of determining the number of pairs of qubit-codes that can be associated with a given quantum computation and a given linear error-correcting code. We study the case of the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code. We prove that the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code is equal to the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code. We also show that the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code is equal to the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code. We also show that the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code is equal to the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code. Finally, we show that the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code is equal to the number of qubit-codes associated with a given linear error-correcting code.
Almost-Everywhere Superiority for Quantum Computing<sep>The quantum computing landscape, a new breed of applications, and the growing demand for quantum computing resources, have broadened the scope of the computing landscape. The fundamental traditionally assumed in quantum computing is the superiority, whereas the quantum computing community has made a significant advancement in this field. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of quantum computing, covering both the theoretical and practical aspects of superiority. We first present the quantum computing research background, covering the major quantum computing fields, including quantum algorithms, quantum hardware, and quantum algorithms. Then, we present the quantum computing frameworks and the quantum computing research gateway (QAGH) for superiority. We discuss the quantum computing efficiency of classical computing and the quantum computing research community in the quantum computing community. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in quantum computing research.
Transition Radiation and the Origin of Sonoluminescence<sep>The radiation emitted by a laser pulse propagating through the plasma generated in a plane-waveed electric field is studied in the case of the linear plasma wakefield acceleration. It is shown that the radiation emitted by a laser pulse can be obtained by a planar electron layer. The radiation emitted by a laser pulse in the plane-waveed electron density gradient is calculated analytically and shown to be well described by a simple analytical model.
Unconditionally Secure Commitment of a Certified Classical Bit is Impossible<sep>We consider the problem of unconditionally secure certified classical bit-pairing commitment (BPPC) in the presence of an adversary who can choose a good bit-pairing scheme and an attacker who can choose the bit-pairing scheme. We show that, in the case of a false-negative-positive (FNP) attack, the problem is equivalent to the existence of a non-trivial commitment function that is based on the mutual information between the input and output of the BPPC system and the output of the BPPC system. We provide an almost complete characterization of the set of non-trivial commitment functions that can be constructed by a non-trivial commitment function, and we show that the set of non-trivial commitment functions that can be constructed by a non-trivial commitment function cannot be approximated by a non-trivial commitment function.
Cheat Sensitive Quantum Bit Commitment<sep>The problem of quantum cheat has been studied for over a century and is still relatively unexplored. This paper focuses on the problem of quantum cheat communication. We show that the problem of cheat sensitive quantum bit commitment is equivalent to the problem of quantum cheat bit commitment. We show that for a fixed number of qubits, the problem of quantum bit commitment is equivalent to the problem of quantum cheat bit commitment. We also show that the problem of quantum cheat bit commitment is equivalent to the problem of quantum cheat bit commitment. We also show that the problem of quantum cheat bit commitment is equivalent to the problem of quantum cheat bit commitment.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the quantum computing paradigm and its relation to the NP-complete problems. We also present a survey of the state-of-the-art on the topic and a taxonomy of the quantum computing paradigm.
Leading Order Temporal Asymptotics of the Modified Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation: Solitonless Sector<sep>We study the non-linear Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary initial condition and a varying nonlinear length scale. We prove that the leading order temporal asymptotics of the modified non-linear Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary initial condition exist. We also prove that the leading order temporal asymptotic behavior of the modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation is identical to that of the standard nonlinear Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary initial condition.
