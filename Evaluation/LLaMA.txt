Computational complexity of the quantum separability problem<sep>We investigate the computational complexity of determining whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled. This problem, known as the quantum separability problem, is of fundamental importance in quantum information processing and has far-reaching implications for our understanding of quantum entanglement. We show that the quantum separability problem is NP-hard, even when restricted to mixed states of two qubits. Our result implies that there exists no efficient algorithm for solving this problem exactly, unless P=NP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the problem remains NP-hard under various relaxations, including when the state is promised to be nearly separable or when the separability criterion is based on a specific entanglement measure. Our findings have significant implications for the study of quantum entanglement and the development of quantum algorithms, highlighting the inherent complexity of manipulating and characterizing entangled quantum systems.
Beyond i.i.d. in Quantum Information Theory<sep>The vast majority of results in quantum information theory rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) systems, which is often at odds with the correlated and finite nature of real-world quantum systems. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for studying quantum information processing beyond the i.i.d. assumption. Our approach, based on the concept of uniform smoothness, allows us to derive non-asymptotic and asymptotic bounds for a wide range of quantum information-theoretic tasks, including quantum source coding, quantum channel coding, and quantum entanglement manipulation. We demonstrate the power of our framework by applying it to several paradigmatic examples of correlated quantum systems, including quantum Markov chains, Gibbs states, and certain classes of many-body systems. Our results provide a rigorous and quantitative understanding of the fundamental limits of quantum information processing in the presence of correlations and finite-size effects, and have implications for the study of quantum many-body systems, quantum metrology, and quantum computing.
On the Role of Shared Entanglement<sep>Shared entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science, enabling quantum communication and computation protocols that surpass classical capabilities. In this work, we investigate the role of shared entanglement in various quantum protocols, including quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and entanglement-based quantum cryptography. We provide a unified framework for understanding the power of shared entanglement, highlighting its ability to enhance quantum correlations, facilitate quantum error correction, and enable secure quantum communication. Our analysis reveals that shared entanglement is not only a necessary resource for many quantum protocols, but also a sufficient one, in the sense that it can be used to generate all other quantum resources, such as quantum coherence and quantum discord. We also explore the relationship between shared entanglement and quantum non-locality, demonstrating that the former is a more fundamental resource that underlies the latter. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our results for the development of quantum technologies, including quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, and quantum simulation platforms. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of shared entanglement in quantum information science, and highlights its potential to revolutionize the way we process and communicate information.
Quantum Versus Classical Proofs and Advice<sep>We study the power of quantum proofs and advice in the context of computational complexity theory. Our results shed new light on the relationship between quantum and classical proof systems, as well as the role of advice in quantum computation. We first consider the setting of proof verification, where a verifier is given a proof string and must decide whether a given statement is true or false. We show that, for certain problems, quantum proofs can be exponentially more concise than their classical counterparts, even when the verifier is allowed to use quantum computation. This result has implications for the study of quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA) proof systems, which are the quantum analogues of NP proof systems. We then turn our attention to the setting of advice, where a computation is given access to a trusted advice string that depends only on the input size. We show that, for certain problems, quantum advice can be exponentially more powerful than classical advice, even when the computation is allowed to use quantum computation. This result has implications for the study of quantum computational complexity, particularly in the context of quantum algorithms and quantum communication protocols. Our results rely on a combination of quantum information-theoretic techniques, including quantum error correction and quantum teleportation, as well as classical complexity-theoretic techniques. They provide new insights into the power of quantum computation and the role of advice in quantum information processing.
Clifford Code Constructions of Operator Quantum Error Correcting Codes<sep>We present a systematic framework for constructing operator quantum error correcting codes using Clifford codes. By leveraging the mathematical structure of Clifford algebras and their associated groups, we develop a method to construct codes that correct errors on multiple physical qubits. Our approach allows for the creation of both stabilizer and non-stabilizer codes, including codes with non-Abelian transversal gates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by constructing several examples of operator quantum error correcting codes with various parameters, including codes with improved thresholds and more efficient decoding algorithms. Our results provide a new avenue for exploring the landscape of quantum error correction and have implications for the development of robust quantum computing architectures.
Strongly Universal Quantum Turing Machines and Invariance of Kolmogorov Complexity<sep>We study the concept of strong universality in the context of quantum Turing machines (QTMs) and its implications for the invariance of quantum Kolmogorov complexity. A QTM is strongly universal if it can simulate any other QTM with at most a polynomial overhead in time and space resources. We show that there exists a strongly universal QTM, which implies that the quantum Kolmogorov complexity of a string is invariant up to an additive constant, independent of the choice of the QTM used to define it. Our results have implications for the study of quantum information and the foundations of quantum mechanics. In particular, they provide a robust and QTM-independent notion of quantum Kolmogorov complexity, which can be used to quantify the complexity of quantum states and processes.
Invertible Quantum Operations and Perfect Encryption of Quantum States<sep>We investigate the conditions under which a quantum operation can be inverted, and apply our results to the problem of perfect encryption of quantum states. We show that a quantum operation can be inverted if and only if it is a unitary transformation, or a probabilistic mixture of unitary transformations. We then consider the problem of encrypting a quantum state in such a way that it can be decrypted with certainty, and show that this is possible if and only if the encryption operation is invertible. We also demonstrate that perfect encryption of a quantum state requires a secret key whose size is at least as large as the size of the state itself. Our results have implications for the study of quantum information and cryptography, and highlight the importance of invertibility in quantum operations.
Quantum Information and Entropy<sep>We investigate the intricate relationship between quantum information and entropy, two fundamental concepts in the realm of quantum mechanics. By employing a range of theoretical tools, including the von Neumann entropy and the relative entropy, we derive novel bounds on the entropic uncertainty principle and demonstrate their implications for quantum information processing. Our results provide new insights into the limitations imposed by entropy on the precision of quantum measurements, and highlight the role of entanglement in mitigating these constraints. Furthermore, we explore the connection between quantum entropy and the information-theoretic notion of quantum channel capacity, revealing a deep interplay between the two. Our analysis yields a new understanding of the trade-offs between information transmission rates and entropic costs in quantum communication protocols. This work contributes to the ongoing quest to elucidate the complex interplay between quantum information, entropy, and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Our findings have significant implications for the development of quantum technologies, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.
Using quantum oblivious transfer to cheat sensitive quantum bit commitment<sep>Quantum bit commitment (QBC) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that enables a party to commit to a bit value without revealing it to the other party. However, it has been shown that unconditionally secure QBC is impossible. We explore a novel attack on sensitive QBC protocols, which are designed to detect cheating attempts with high probability. Our attack utilizes quantum oblivious transfer (QOT), a protocol that allows a party to transfer a bit value to another party without revealing the value itself. We demonstrate that by employing QOT, an adversary can cheat sensitive QBC protocols with a high probability of success, rendering them insecure. Our results have significant implications for the design of secure quantum cryptographic protocols and highlight the importance of considering the interplay between different quantum cryptographic primitives.
The BQP-hardness of approximating the Jones Polynomial<sep>We establish a fundamental connection between two seemingly disparate fields: quantum computation and knot theory. Specifically, we show that approximating the Jones polynomial of a braid at a root of unity to within a certain precision is BQP-hard. This means that any efficient algorithm for approximating the Jones polynomial to this precision would imply an efficient solution to any problem in BQP, the class of problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time. Our result is based on a novel encoding of quantum circuits into braids, which enables us to translate quantum computations into evaluations of the Jones polynomial. By leveraging this connection, we demonstrate that approximating the Jones polynomial is as hard as simulating an arbitrary quantum computation. This work has significant implications for both quantum computing and knot theory. On one hand, it provides a new perspective on the computational power of quantum systems, highlighting the intricate relationships between quantum mechanics and topological invariants. On the other hand, it reveals the inherent difficulty of approximating the Jones polynomial, a problem with far-reaching implications in low-dimensional topology and mathematical physics.
Maximally Non-Local and Monogamous Quantum Correlations<sep>Quantum non-locality and monogamy are fundamental properties of quantum correlations that distinguish them from their classical counterparts. We investigate the relationship between these two properties by identifying the set of maximally non-local correlations that are also monogamous. Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we show that these correlations correspond to a specific subset of no-signaling boxes that are uniquely determined by the no-signaling principle and the requirement of monogamy. Our results provide new insights into the structure of quantum correlations and shed light on the interplay between non-locality and monogamy in the quantum world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the monogamy of quantum correlations can be used as a resource for quantum cryptography and other quantum information processing tasks.
Classical simulators of quantum computers and no-go theorems<sep>We investigate the limitations of classical simulators for quantum computers, focusing on the trade-offs between computational resources and simulation accuracy. By analyzing the scaling behavior of various classical simulation methods, we identify fundamental constraints that preclude efficient simulation of large-scale quantum computations. Our results are formalized as a set of no-go theorems, which establish that any classical simulator must either require exponential resources or incur significant errors, rendering it unsuitable for simulating complex quantum systems. These findings have implications for the development of practical quantum computing architectures and highlight the essential role of quantum hardware in solving certain computational problems.
Full security of quantum key distribution from no-signaling constraints<sep>We provide a comprehensive security proof for quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols based solely on the no-signaling principle, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. Our approach is device-independent and does not rely on any specific assumptions about the internal workings of the quantum devices used in the protocol. We show that any no-signaling adversary is unable to obtain information about the shared key, even in the presence of arbitrary device imperfections and errors. Our proof is based on a novel application of the no-signaling principle to the security analysis of QKD, and it provides a unified framework for understanding the security of a wide range of QKD protocols. Our results demonstrate that QKD can be made fully secure against any no-signaling attack, and they have important implications for the development of secure quantum communication networks.
Exponential Separation of Quantum and Classical Online Space Complexity<sep>We resolve a long-standing open problem in the study of online space complexity by demonstrating an exponential separation between the space complexity of quantum and classical algorithms for an online problem. Specifically, we exhibit a problem that can be solved by a quantum algorithm using O(log n) bits of memory, while any classical algorithm solving the same problem requires ?(n) bits of memory. Our result relies on a careful analysis of the power of quantum mechanics to solve online problems more efficiently than classical algorithms, and we introduce new techniques for bounding the space complexity of online quantum algorithms. These techniques have far-reaching implications for the study of quantum algorithms and the power of quantum computation. Our results also have significant implications for the study of online algorithms and the power of online computation. We demonstrate that the power of online quantum computation can be exponentially greater than the power of online classical computation, even for problems that are not typically considered to be "quantum" in nature.
On the quantum analogue of Galileo's leaning tower experiment<sep>We propose a thought-provoking quantum analogue of Galileo's iconic leaning tower experiment, which historically challenged the Aristotelian view of gravity. By replacing the classical objects with particles in a superposition of states, we investigate the role of quantum gravity in a controlled, Gedanken experiment setting. Our analysis reveals intriguing parallels between the quantum and classical regimes, with the former exhibiting a unique signature of wave-particle duality. We consider a quantum particle, initially prepared in a superposition of energy eigenstates, released from a "quantum tower" in a gravitational field. By solving the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation, we demonstrate that the particle's wave function exhibits a characteristic "leaning" behavior, analogous to the classical trajectory of an object under the sole influence of gravity. Our study highlights the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity, providing a novel perspective on the long-standing problem of reconciling these two fundamental theories. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of a consistent theory of quantum gravity and propose potential experimental realizations to test the predictions of our model.
`Plausibilities of plausibilities': an approach through circumstances<sep>We introduce a novel framework for reasoning about higher-order plausibilities, which we term "plausibilities of plausibilities." This framework seeks to capture the complex, self-referential nature of uncertain reasoning by encoding plausibilities as functions of circumstances. Our approach enables the explicit representation of uncertainty about uncertainty, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between evidence, context, and inference. By recursively applying our plausibility framework, we demonstrate the ability to reason about the plausibility of plausibility statements themselves, providing a principled means of navigating the regress problem in uncertain reasoning. We illustrate the utility of our approach through a series of examples, highlighting its potential applications in areas such as decision-making under uncertainty, probabilistic inference, and artificial intelligence. Our work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the foundations of uncertain reasoning, offering a new perspective on the representation and manipulation of higher-order plausibilities. By embracing the complexities of uncertainty, our framework provides a rich and expressive language for reasoning about the plausibilities of plausibilities.
The one-way communication complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching Problem<sep>We consider the Boolean Hidden Matching Problem, a communication problem in which Alice holds a Boolean vector x of length n and Bob holds a perfect matching M on n vertices and a Boolean vector w of length n/2. The goal is for Bob to determine whether there exists an edge in M such that the values of x corresponding to the endpoints of the edge are both 1 and the corresponding value of w is 1. We study the one-way communication complexity of this problem, in which Alice sends a single message to Bob, who then outputs the answer. We show that the one-way communication complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching Problem is ?(n), even when Bob's matching M is chosen randomly. This lower bound holds for both deterministic and randomized protocols. We also show that this lower bound is tight, by exhibiting a one-way protocol that achieves an upper bound of O(n) bits of communication. Our results have implications for the study of communication complexity and the power of one-way communication. In particular, they demonstrate that one-way communication can be strictly weaker than two-way communication for certain problems, even when the communication is allowed to be randomized.
Exponential Separation of Quantum and Classical One-Way Communication Complexity for a Boolean Function<sep>We establish an exponential separation between quantum and classical one-way communication complexity for a Boolean function. Specifically, we exhibit a function for which the quantum one-way communication complexity is logarithmic in the input size, while the classical one-way communication complexity is linear. Our result provides strong evidence for the superiority of quantum communication over classical communication in certain scenarios. Our separation is demonstrated using a novel application of the Holevo bound and the concept of information-theoretic discrepancy. We also introduce a new technique for analyzing quantum communication protocols, which may be of independent interest. Our findings have implications for the study of quantum communication complexity and the development of quantum communication protocols that outperform their classical counterparts.
Search via Quantum Walk<sep>We present a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database of N entries in O(N) time, improving upon the O(N) time required by classical algorithms. Our approach employs a quantum walk on a graph, where the vertices represent the database entries and the edges connect adjacent vertices. By applying a quantum circuit that implements a random walk on this graph, we create a superposition of states that can be used to find the target entry with high probability. We analyze the performance of our algorithm and show that it achieves a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum walks for solving search problems and have implications for the development of efficient quantum algorithms.
Secure Controlled Teleportation<sep>We propose a novel protocol for secure controlled teleportation of quantum information, enabling the transfer of an arbitrary quantum state from a sender to a receiver under the supervision of a controller. Our protocol ensures that the quantum state can only be recovered by the receiver when the controller authorizes the transfer, while preventing any unauthorized access to the information. We employ a combination of quantum entanglement, local operations, and classical communication to achieve secure controlled teleportation. The security of our protocol is guaranteed by the no-cloning theorem and the properties of entangled states. We analyze the protocol's robustness against various types of attacks and demonstrate its feasibility with current quantum technologies. Our results have significant implications for the development of secure quantum communication networks and the implementation of quantum cryptography protocols.
Quantum Pattern Retrieval by Qubit Networks with Hebb Interactions<sep>We investigate the capabilities of qubit networks with Hebb interactions for quantum pattern retrieval. Inspired by classical neural networks, we introduce a quantum model where qubits are interconnected via Hebbian couplings, allowing for the storage and recall of quantum patterns. By analyzing the quantum dynamics of the network, we demonstrate that the system is capable of retrieving stored patterns in a probabilistic manner, exhibiting a robustness against decoherence and noise. We further explore the effects of quantum entanglement and non-locality on the retrieval process, revealing a significant enhancement of the network's performance compared to its classical counterpart. Our results suggest that qubit networks with Hebb interactions hold great promise for the development of quantum information processing systems, particularly in the context of quantum machine learning and pattern recognition. The proposed model may also provide insights into the quantum mechanisms underlying biological neural networks.
On the Impossibility of a Quantum Sieve Algorithm for Graph Isomorphism<sep>We investigate the possibility of constructing a quantum sieve algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem, a long-standing open problem in computer science. By leveraging connections between GI and the hidden subgroup problem, we establish strong limitations on the effectiveness of a broad class of quantum sieve algorithms for GI. Our main result shows that any quantum sieve algorithm for GI that relies on a certain natural framework for reducing GI to a hidden subgroup problem must have an exponential overhead in the number of iterations required to achieve a non-negligible probability of success. This lower bound holds even for algorithms that exploit the full power of quantum parallelism and interference. Our proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, representation theory, and classical complexity theory to establish a fundamental limit on the ability of quantum sieve algorithms to solve GI. This result provides strong evidence that a quantum sieve algorithm for GI is unlikely to provide a significant speedup over the best known classical algorithms for this problem.
Group Theoretical Formulation of Quantum Partial Search Algorithm<sep>We present a group theoretical formulation of the quantum partial search algorithm, a quantum algorithm that searches an unsorted database with a partial information about the target block. By exploiting the symmetry of the problem, we identify the underlying group structure and use the representation theory to analyze the algorithm. We show that the algorithm can be viewed as a sequence of transformations in the Hilbert space that can be expressed in terms of the irreducible representations of the group. This formulation allows us to derive an analytical expression for the success probability of the algorithm and provides a deeper understanding of its properties. Our results demonstrate the power of group theoretical methods in analyzing and improving quantum algorithms.
Ergodic Classical-Quantum Channels: Structure and Coding Theorems<sep>We investigate the structure and asymptotic transmission capabilities of ergodic classical-quantum (CQ) channels. These channels model the interaction between a classical information source and a quantum communication system, where the channel's behavior is characterized by a time-invariant measure on the set of quantum states. Our main contribution is a comprehensive framework for understanding the properties of ergodic CQ channels, including their classical capacity, error-exponent, and channel dispersion. We first establish a general structure theorem for ergodic CQ channels, which allows us to decompose the channel into a collection of irreducible, ergodic components. This decomposition enables us to derive a coding theorem, which asserts that the classical capacity of an ergodic CQ channel is equal to the Shannon capacity of its stationary, memoryless counterpart. We then turn our attention to the error-exponent of ergodic CQ channels, which characterizes the rate at which the probability of decoding error decays as a function of the blocklength. We derive a Gallager-type bound on the error-exponent, which is shown to be tight for a class of channels satisfying a certain "mixing" condition. Finally, we investigate the channel dispersion of ergodic CQ channels, which quantifies the fluctuations in the channel's behavior as a function of the blocklength. We derive a central limit theorem for the channel dispersion, which implies that the classical capacity of an ergodic CQ channel can be approached with a second-order rate that is inversely proportional to the square root of the blocklength. Our results have implications for the design of efficient coding schemes for classical-quantum communication systems, and provide a foundation for further research into the asymptotic properties of quantum channels.
Subsystem Codes<sep>We introduce a new framework for quantum error correction, which we call subsystem codes. Unlike traditional subspace codes, which encode quantum information into a subspace of a larger Hilbert space, subsystem codes encode information into a subsystem of a larger system. This allows for more flexible and efficient use of quantum resources, as well as improved thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We provide a general formalism for constructing and analyzing subsystem codes, and demonstrate the advantages of this approach with several examples. Our results have implications for the design of quantum error correction protocols and the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.
Quantum List Decoding of Classical Block Codes of Polynomially Small Rate from Quantumly Corrupted Codewords<sep>We consider the problem of list decoding classical block codes from quantumly corrupted codewords. Specifically, given a classical block code with a polynomially small rate, we investigate the possibility of recovering the encoded message when the codeword is subjected to a quantum noise model, such as the depolarizing channel. Our main contribution is a quantum list decoding algorithm that can recover the encoded message with high probability, provided that the noise level is below a certain threshold. The algorithm leverages the principles of quantum error correction and the structure of the classical block code to identify a list of candidate codewords that are close to the corrupted codeword. We analyze the performance of our algorithm using tools from quantum information theory and coding theory. Our results show that, for a wide range of classical block codes, including Reed-Solomon codes and Reed-Muller codes, the algorithm can tolerate a noise level that is polynomially small in the block length. Our work has implications for the study of quantum error correction and the development of robust quantum communication protocols. In particular, it highlights the potential benefits of combining classical coding techniques with quantum error correction principles to achieve reliable communication over noisy quantum channels.
Merlin-Arthur Games and Stoquastic Complexity<sep>We study the complexity of stoquastic local Hamiltonians, a class of physically motivated quantum many-body systems. We show that determining the ground state energy of a stoquastic Hamiltonian is MA-complete, where MA is the class of decision problems that can be verified by a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier with the help of a Merlin, an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is the first example of a natural problem that is known to be MA-complete. Our proof is based on a new characterization of MA in terms of a variant of quantum Merlin-Arthur games, which we call the "stoquastic MA" model. In this model, Merlin sends a quantum witness state to Arthur, who then applies a stoquastic local measurement to verify the witness. We show that this model is equivalent to the standard MA model, and that it provides a more natural framework for studying the complexity of stoquastic Hamiltonians. Our results have implications for the study of quantum many-body systems and the complexity of quantum simulation. In particular, they suggest that determining the ground state energy of a stoquastic Hamiltonian is a fundamentally harder problem than determining the ground state energy of a classical Hamiltonian.
Approximate Randomization of Quantum States With Fewer Bits of Key<sep>Randomization of quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information processing, enabling the secure disposal of sensitive quantum information and the generation of randomness. However, existing protocols for randomizing quantum states require a significant amount of randomness, typically in the form of a uniformly distributed key. In this work, we introduce a new protocol for approximate randomization of quantum states that achieves near-optimal randomness using fewer bits of key. Our protocol leverages the properties of quantum entanglement and the concentration of measure phenomenon to efficiently randomize quantum states. We provide a rigorous analysis of the protocol's performance, establishing an upper bound on the required key length and a lower bound on the resulting randomness. Our results demonstrate that approximate randomization of quantum states can be achieved with significantly fewer bits of key than previously thought, opening up new possibilities for efficient and secure quantum information processing.
Continuous Variable Quantum Cryptography using Two-Way Quantum Communication<sep>We propose a novel continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol utilizing two-way quantum communication. Unlike traditional CVQKD protocols that rely on one-way quantum transmission, our scheme leverages the benefits of two-way quantum communication to enhance the security and efficiency of the key exchange. By employing a two-way quantum channel, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol can tolerate higher channel losses and increase the secure key rate compared to conventional one-way CVQKD protocols. We derive the security bounds for the proposed protocol against general attacks, including collective and coherent attacks. Our results show that the two-way CVQKD protocol can achieve a higher secure key rate over longer distances, paving the way for more practical and secure quantum cryptography applications. The proposed protocol has the potential to be implemented with current technology, making it an attractive solution for secure communication over long distances.
Toward a general theory of quantum games<sep>We initiate a comprehensive study of quantum games, aiming to establish a unified framework for understanding strategic decision-making in quantum mechanical settings. By combining fundamental concepts from quantum information theory and game theory, we develop a formal structure for analyzing quantum games, encompassing both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. Our framework allows for the characterization of quantum Nash equilibria, the exploration of quantum strategic spaces, and the investigation of quantum entanglement as a resource for correlated strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to several paradigmatic examples, including quantum prisoner's dilemma, quantum auctions, and quantum Stackelberg duopoly. Our results highlight the potential for quantum games to exhibit novel features and behaviors that depart from their classical counterparts, and lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of quantum strategic interactions. By providing a rigorous and versatile framework for the study of quantum games, our work paves the way for further research into the theoretical foundations and practical applications of quantum game theory.
A Tight High-Order Entropic Quantum Uncertainty Relation With Applications<sep>We derive a tight high-order entropic quantum uncertainty relation for two arbitrary observables, generalizing the existing entropic uncertainty relations to higher-order moments. Our relation captures the trade-off between the uncertainties of two observables in terms of their R?nyi entropies, providing a more comprehensive characterization of the uncertainty principle. We demonstrate the tightness of our relation by showing that it reduces to the known entropic uncertainty relations in the special cases of Shannon entropy and min-entropy. Furthermore, we illustrate the applications of our relation in various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, and entanglement detection. Our results provide a new tool for analyzing the fundamental limits of precision in quantum measurements and have the potential to enhance the performance of quantum information processing protocols.
Deciding whether a quantum state has secret correlations is an NP-complete problem<sep>We investigate the computational complexity of determining whether a given quantum state exhibits secret correlations, also known as non-local hidden information. Secret correlations are a fundamental resource in quantum cryptography and quantum communication, allowing for secure information transmission over public channels. In this work, we show that deciding whether a quantum state has secret correlations is an NP-complete problem. This result has significant implications for the study of quantum cryptography and the development of efficient algorithms for detecting and exploiting secret correlations. Our proof involves a reduction from the clique problem, a well-known NP-complete problem, and relies on the construction of a specific class of quantum states that exhibit secret correlations if and only if a given graph has a large clique. Our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of detecting secret correlations in quantum systems and underscore the need for novel approaches to this problem.
How a Clebsch-Gordan Transform Helps to Solve the Heisenberg Hidden Subgroup Problem<sep>We present a quantum algorithm to solve the Heisenberg Hidden Subgroup Problem (HHSP), a fundamental problem in quantum computing that has applications in quantum error correction, quantum simulation, and post-quantum cryptography. Our approach leverages the Clebsch-Gordan transform, a mathematical tool from representation theory, to efficiently solve the HHSP. By applying the Clebsch-Gordan transform to the Heisenberg group, we are able to decompose the group into a direct sum of irreducible representations, which enables us to identify the hidden subgroup. Our algorithm has a time complexity of O(poly(log |G|)), where |G| is the order of the Heisenberg group, making it exponentially faster than classical algorithms for this problem. Our results demonstrate the power of representation theory in solving complex problems in quantum computing and have implications for the development of efficient quantum algorithms for other hidden subgroup problems. Furthermore, our algorithm provides a new tool for the study of quantum error correction and quantum simulation, where the Heisenberg group plays a central role.
A father protocol for quantum broadcast channels<sep>We consider the problem of quantum communication over a broadcast channel, where a single sender transmits quantum information to multiple receivers. In this work, we propose a father protocol for quantum broadcast channels, which enables the efficient transmission of quantum information to multiple receivers with a single encoder. Our protocol is based on a novel application of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem and utilizes a classical communication feedback channel to achieve high rates of quantum information transmission. We derive the achievable rate region for our protocol and show that it approaches the optimal rate region in the limit of large block lengths. We also demonstrate that our protocol can be used to achieve the capacity of a quantum broadcast channel with a single encoder, and discuss the implications of our results for the study of quantum network information theory. Our work provides a new framework for the study of quantum communication over broadcast channels and has potential applications in the development of quantum networks and multi-user quantum communication systems.
Lineal: A linear-algebraic Lambda-calculus<sep>We introduce Lineal, a novel lambda-calculus that integrates the mathematical structures of linear algebra into the fundamental framework of the lambda-calculus. By representing lambda-terms as linear transformations, Lineal provides a unified framework for expressing and reasoning about linear algebraic operations, such as matrix multiplication and tensor contraction, within the context of higher-order functions. Lineal's type system, based on a novel notion of linear types, ensures that linear algebraic operations are sound and composable, while its operational semantics, based on a linear-algebraic notion of beta-reduction, provides a precise and efficient way to evaluate Lineal programs. We demonstrate the expressiveness and flexibility of Lineal by showing how it can be used to encode a range of linear algebraic algorithms and data structures, including linear regression, singular value decomposition, and tensor networks. We also explore the connections between Lineal and existing programming languages and formal systems, such as functional programming languages and categorical semantics. Overall, Lineal provides a new foundation for the study of linear algebraic programming, and has the potential to enable the development of more efficient, composable, and scalable linear algebraic algorithms and software systems.
Quantum Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes<sep>We present a new class of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which we term quantum quasi-cyclic LDPC (QQCLDPC) codes. By leveraging the quasi-cyclic structure of classical LDPC codes, we construct quantum codes that exhibit improved error correction capabilities while maintaining efficient decoding algorithms. Our construction method yields a family of QQCLDPC codes with varying block lengths and code rates, allowing for flexible design choices depending on the specific application. We demonstrate that these codes have a lower error floor compared to existing quantum LDPC codes, making them attractive candidates for quantum error correction in near-term quantum computing and quantum communication systems. Additionally, we propose a modified decoding algorithm tailored to the quasi-cyclic structure of our codes, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the decoding process. Our results contribute to the ongoing effort to develop robust and efficient quantum error correction techniques, a crucial component in the development of reliable quantum technologies.
Quantum Convolutional Codes Derived From Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller Codes<sep>We introduce a new class of quantum convolutional codes (QCCs) derived from classical Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes. By exploiting the inherent structure of these classical codes, we demonstrate that our QCCs inherit desirable properties such as high error-correcting capabilities and efficient decoding algorithms. Specifically, we construct QCCs with optimally bounded minimum distances, which guarantees reliable quantum error correction for a wide range of quantum channels. Our construction also enables the efficient implementation of quantum error correction using classical decoding algorithms, thereby reducing the computational overhead associated with quantum error correction. We analyze the performance of our QCCs and demonstrate that they outperform existing QCCs in terms of error-correcting capabilities and decoding efficiency. Our results provide a new avenue for exploring the intersection of classical and quantum coding theory, with potential applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.
A presentation of Quantum Logic based on an "and then" connective<sep>We present a novel approach to quantum logic, centered around a binary connective that can be interpreted as "and then". This connective, which we denote by ?, captures the temporal and causal relationships between events in a quantum system. We show that our "and then" logic provides a more intuitive and expressive framework for reasoning about quantum phenomena than traditional quantum logics based on static connectives such as ? and ?. Our approach is based on a syntax-semantics duality, where the syntax is given by a sequent calculus for ?, and the semantics is provided by a categorical framework that generalizes the standard Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics. We prove soundness and completeness theorems for our sequent calculus, and demonstrate its equivalence to the standard quantum logic of von Neumann. The "and then" connective allows us to express quantum protocols and algorithms in a more natural and compositional way, making it easier to reason about their correctness and complexity. Our framework also provides a new perspective on the foundations of quantum mechanics, highlighting the role of time and causality in the structure of quantum reality.
Using quantum key distribution for cryptographic purposes: a survey<sep>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has emerged as a promising solution for secure key exchange, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to provide unconditional security. In recent years, QKD has gained significant attention for its potential to revolutionize the field of cryptography. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of QKD for cryptographic purposes, covering the fundamental principles, protocols, and implementations. We discuss the advantages and limitations of QKD, as well as its integration with classical cryptographic systems. We also examine the current challenges and future directions in QKD research, including the development of practical QKD systems, security proofs, and applications in various domains. Our survey aims to provide a thorough understanding of QKD's role in modern cryptography, highlighting its potential to enhance the security of communication networks and protect against emerging threats.
Turning the Liar paradox into a metatheorem of Basic logic<sep>We present a novel approach to the Liar paradox, a foundational challenge in logic and philosophy. Rather than attempting to resolve the paradox through semantic or syntactic restrictions, we show that it can be transformed into a metatheorem of Basic logic. By formally encoding the Liar sentence within a Basic logic framework, we derive a metatheorem that captures the essence of the paradox. This metatheorem, which we call the "Liar Metatheorem," states that any sufficiently expressive Basic logic system cannot be both sound and complete. Our approach relies on a careful analysis of the Liar sentence's self-referential structure and its implications for the soundness and completeness of Basic logic systems. We demonstrate that the Liar Metatheorem has far-reaching consequences for our understanding of truth, self-reference, and the foundations of logic. The Liar Metatheorem provides a new perspective on the Liar paradox, one that highlights the inherent limitations of formal systems and the importance of metatheoretical reasoning. Our results have significant implications for the study of logic, philosophy, and the foundations of mathematics.
A decoupling approach to the quantum capacity<sep>We introduce a decoupling approach to the quantum capacity of a quantum channel, providing an alternative perspective on the fundamental limits of reliable quantum information transmission. By leveraging the decoupling theorem from quantum information theory, we establish a general framework for characterizing the quantum capacity of arbitrary quantum channels. Our approach is based on the idea of decoupling the system of interest from its environment, thereby effectively removing the correlations that can impede reliable quantum communication. We demonstrate the power of this approach by deriving upper bounds on the quantum capacity of various classes of quantum channels, including those with memory and those subjected to correlated noise. Furthermore, we show that our decoupling approach can be used to recover known results on the quantum capacity of certain channels, such as the depolarizing channel and the erasure channel. Our results have implications for the study of quantum communication protocols and the design of reliable quantum information processing systems.
Markovian Entanglement Networks<sep>We introduce Markovian Entanglement Networks (MEN), a novel probabilistic framework for modeling the dynamics of entanglement in complex quantum systems. By representing entanglement as a Markov process on a network, MEN provide a scalable and interpretable approach to understanding the emergence and evolution of entanglement in various quantum settings. Our framework leverages the mathematical machinery of Markov chains and random walks to describe the stochastic dynamics of entanglement, allowing for the efficient simulation and analysis of large-scale entangled systems. We demonstrate the versatility of MEN by applying them to a range of quantum systems, including many-body systems, quantum circuits, and open quantum systems. Our results reveal new insights into the statistical properties of entanglement and its relationship to quantum information processing. The MEN framework has far-reaching implications for the study of quantum entanglement and its applications in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum metrology.
Quantum Key Distribution with Classical Bob<sep>We propose a novel quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that enables secure key exchange between a quantum-equipped party (Alice) and a classical party (Bob). In contrast to traditional QKD protocols, which require both parties to possess quantum capabilities, our protocol allows Bob to remain classical, reducing the technological burden and enabling a wider range of applications. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics and classical post-processing, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve unconditional security against any eavesdropper, while tolerating a significant amount of noise and loss in the communication channel. We provide a rigorous security proof and analyze the protocol's performance in various scenarios, including those with realistic experimental parameters. Our results pave the way for the development of QKD systems that can be integrated with existing classical infrastructure, making quantum-secured communication more accessible and practical for real-world applications.
Graphs, Quadratic Forms, and Quantum Codes<sep>We establish a novel connection between graphs, quadratic forms, and quantum codes, revealing a profound interplay between combinatorial, algebraic, and quantum structures. By associating graphs with quadratic forms over finite fields, we demonstrate a constructive method for generating entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes. Our approach leverages the adjacency matrix of a graph to define a quadratic form Q, which is then used to construct a stabilizer code. The properties of the graph, such as its connectivity and symmetry, are shown to influence the parameters of the resulting quantum code, including its distance, dimension, and entanglement requirements. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between graph invariants, such as the graph spectrum and the Tutte polynomial, and the properties of the associated quantum code. Our results provide a new framework for understanding the intricate relationships between graphs, quadratic forms, and quantum codes, shedding light on the potential benefits of integrating combinatorial and algebraic techniques in the design of quantum error-correcting codes.
Quantum Convolutional BCH Codes<sep>We introduce a new class of quantum error-correcting codes, Quantum Convolutional BCH (QC-BCH) codes, which leverage the principles of classical convolutional BCH codes to provide robust protection against errors in quantum information processing. By exploiting the inherent structure of BCH codes, our construction yields a family of quantum codes with desirable properties, including high error thresholds, efficient encoding and decoding algorithms, and adaptability to various quantum channel models. QC-BCH codes are constructed by embedding classical BCH codes into the quantum domain using the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, which enables the correction of both bit-flip and phase-flip errors. We derive bounds on the minimum distance and error thresholds of QC-BCH codes, demonstrating their competitiveness with other quantum error-correcting codes. Our results also show that QC-BCH codes can be efficiently decoded using a modified version of the classical Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which takes advantage of the convolutional structure of the code. This enables the correction of errors in real-time, making QC-BCH codes suitable for applications in quantum communication and computation.
Semidefinite programming characterization and spectral adversary method for quantum complexity with noncommuting unitary queries<sep>We investigate the quantum query complexity of problems with noncommuting unitary queries, a fundamental model that encompasses a wide range of quantum algorithms. We provide a semidefinite programming (SDP) characterization of the quantum query complexity in this setting, which is based on a novel application of the noncommutative polynomial optimization theory. Our main contribution is the development of a spectral adversary method for noncommuting unitary queries, which is a generalization of the classical adversary method. This approach allows us to establish lower bounds on the quantum query complexity by analyzing the spectral properties of a certain matrix associated with the problem. We demonstrate the power of our method by applying it to several problems, including the quantum query complexity of the OR function, the threshold function, and the unordered search problem. Our results provide new insights into the quantum query complexity of these problems and shed light on the role of noncommutativity in quantum computation. Our SDP characterization and spectral adversary method have implications for the study of quantum algorithms and quantum information processing, and open up new avenues for research in these areas.
Quantum Block and Convolutional Codes from Self-orthogonal Product Codes<sep>We introduce a new method for constructing quantum block and convolutional codes from self-orthogonal product codes. By leveraging the inherent structure of product codes, we demonstrate how to systematically generate a wide range of quantum codes with desirable properties, including high error thresholds and efficient decoding algorithms. Our approach involves mapping self-orthogonal product codes to Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which are then used to construct quantum block codes. We also show how to extend this framework to construct quantum convolutional codes, enabling the protection of quantum information in continuous-variable systems. The resulting codes exhibit improved error correction capabilities and robustness against decoherence, making them suitable for various quantum computing and communication applications. Our work provides a new avenue for exploring the intersection of classical coding theory and quantum information science, with potential implications for the development of fault-tolerant quantum technologies.
Constructions of Quantum Convolutional Codes<sep>Quantum convolutional codes are a crucial component in the development of reliable quantum communication and computation systems. In this paper, we present several constructions of quantum convolutional codes, leveraging classical convolutional codes and exploiting the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. We first provide a systematic method for constructing quantum convolutional codes from classical convolutional codes, which enables the creation of a wide range of quantum codes with varying parameters. We then introduce a new construction technique that combines classical convolutional codes with the CSS construction, resulting in quantum convolutional codes with improved error-correcting capabilities. Additionally, we investigate the properties of these constructed codes, including their error thresholds, encoding and decoding complexities, and asymptotic behaviors. Our results demonstrate the potential of these constructions to yield high-performance quantum convolutional codes, paving the way for the development of robust quantum communication and computation systems.
Classical Interaction Cannot Replace a Quantum Message<sep>We investigate the fundamental limits of quantum communication in the presence of classical interaction. In a classical-quantum setting, two parties can exchange arbitrary amounts of classical information and share a classical random variable, but their quantum communication is restricted to a single message. We show that, even with unlimited classical interaction, a single quantum message of a certain dimension cannot be perfectly simulated by classical communication. Our result provides a rigorous proof that classical interaction cannot replace a quantum message, highlighting the inherent advantages of quantum communication over classical methods. This has significant implications for the study of quantum communication protocols and the development of new quantum information processing technologies.
Is Quantum Bit Commitment Really Possible?<sep>Quantum bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that enables a party to commit a secret bit to another party in such a way that the committed bit cannot be changed after the commitment is made, yet remains concealed until the commitment is revealed. While quantum bit commitment protocols have been proposed and widely studied, the question of whether they can be made unconditionally secure remains an open problem. In this paper, we revisit the concept of quantum bit commitment and examine the possibility of achieving unconditional security. We analyze existing protocols and identify potential security flaws that can be exploited by an adversary. Our results show that all previously proposed quantum bit commitment protocols are vulnerable to attacks that compromise their security. Furthermore, we provide a general no-go theorem that demonstrates the impossibility of achieving unconditional security in quantum bit commitment protocols. Our theorem is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and applies to any protocol that relies on the exchange of quantum information. Our findings have significant implications for the field of quantum cryptography and highlight the need for a reevaluation of the security assumptions underlying quantum bit commitment protocols. We conclude that the unconditional security of quantum bit commitment remains an elusive goal, and that any secure implementation of this primitive will require a thorough understanding of the fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics.
A decision procedure for unitary linear quantum cellular automata<sep>We present a decision procedure for determining whether a given linear quantum cellular automaton (QCA) is unitary. QCAs are a fundamental model of quantum computation, consisting of a lattice of quantum systems evolving according to local rules. The unitarity of a QCA is a crucial property, as it guarantees the reversibility and preservation of quantum information throughout the computation. Our procedure is based on a novel characterization of unitary QCAs in terms of a set of local constraints on the transition matrix. We show that these constraints can be efficiently checked using a combination of linear algebra and graph-theoretic techniques. This allows us to determine whether a given QCA is unitary in a time that scales polynomially with the size of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure by applying it to a range of examples, including well-known QCAs such as the quantum Game of Life and the quantum Ising model. Our results provide a new tool for the study and design of QCAs, and have implications for the development of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation protocols.
A Quantum Algorithm for Finding the Minimum<sep>We present a quantum algorithm for finding the minimum value in an unsorted list of N distinct elements. This problem has a lower bound of ?(N) queries in the classical case, but we show that a quantum computer can solve it with O(?N) queries. Our algorithm uses a quantum version of the well-known "divide and conquer" approach, and its correctness relies on the principles of quantum parallelism and interference. We also discuss some potential applications of this algorithm, including the solution of optimization problems and the search for the minimum value in a large database. Our result provides another example of a problem for which quantum computers can achieve a significant speedup over classical computers.
Insecurity of Quantum Secure Computations<sep>Quantum Secure Computations (QSC) have long been touted as the ultimate solution for secure multi-party computations, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of computations. However, a closer examination of the fundamental assumptions underlying QSC reveals a plethora of hitherto unaddressed vulnerabilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that the oft-cited "no-cloning theorem" and "quantum entanglement" - cornerstones of QSC's purported security - can, in fact, be exploited to compromise the integrity of computations. Specifically, we show that an adversarial party can subtly manipulate the quantum states used in QSC, effectively "poisoning" the computation and rendering the outcome unreliable. Furthermore, we highlight a previously overlooked issue with the notion of "quantum authentication" - a crucial component of QSC protocols. By exploiting the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, an attacker can create a "quantum forgery" that convincingly mimics the authentication signature, thereby undermining the trustworthiness of the computation. Our findings challenge the long-held assumption that QSC is inherently secure and instead reveal a complex landscape of vulnerabilities that must be carefully addressed. We propose a revised framework for QSC that incorporates robust countermeasures against these newly identified threats and underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and computational security.
Reversible Simulation of Irreversible Computation by Pebble Games<sep>We present a reversible simulation of irreversible computation using pebble games, a combinatorial game played on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Our construction demonstrates that any irreversible computation can be efficiently simulated by a reversible one, with only a modest increase in time and space complexity. Specifically, we show that any irreversible computation that uses T steps and S bits of memory can be simulated by a reversible computation that uses O(T) steps and O(SlogT) bits of memory. Our approach is based on a novel application of pebble games to reversible computation. We show that any irreversible computation can be represented as a pebble game on a DAG, and that this game can be simulated by a reversible computation that uses a simple and efficient strategy for placing and removing pebbles. Our results have implications for the study of reversible computation, which is an important area of research in theoretical computer science. Reversible computation has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of computational devices, and our construction provides a new and efficient method for simulating irreversible computations in a reversible manner.
Reversibility and Adiabatic Computation: Trading Time and Space for Energy<sep>We explore the relationship between energy consumption and computational resources in the context of reversible and adiabatic computing. By leveraging the principles of thermodynamics and the concept of reversible computation, we demonstrate that it is possible to trade off time and space complexity for energy efficiency in computational systems. Specifically, we show that adiabatic computing, which asymptotically approaches reversible computation, can be used to reduce energy consumption at the cost of increased computation time and space requirements. Our results have significant implications for the design of energy-efficient computing systems and highlight the potential benefits of adopting reversible and adiabatic computing paradigms in the pursuit of sustainable computing.
"Minus c" Symmetry in Classical and Quantum Theories<sep>We explore the implications of a novel symmetry, dubbed "Minus c" (Mc) symmetry, in both classical and quantum theories. This symmetry arises from the observation that many fundamental physical laws remain invariant under the substitution of the speed of light c with its negative counterpart, -c. We demonstrate that the Mc symmetry has far-reaching consequences for our understanding of spacetime, matter-energy equivalence, and the behavior of particles at relativistic energies. In the classical context, we show that the Mc symmetry leads to a modified relativistic kinematics, which in turn affects the predictions of special relativity. We derive the implications of this symmetry for the motion of objects at high speeds and discuss potential experimental tests. In the quantum realm, we investigate the impact of the Mc symmetry on the Dirac equation and the behavior of fermions. We find that the Mc symmetry gives rise to a new class of solutions, which exhibit unusual properties and may have implications for our understanding of particle physics. Our results suggest that the Mc symmetry is a powerful tool for exploring the fundamental laws of physics and may lead to novel insights into the nature of spacetime and matter. We discuss potential applications of this symmetry in various areas of physics, from particle physics to cosmology.
Computing Local Invariants of Qubit Systems<sep>We present an efficient algorithm for computing local invariants of qubit systems, a crucial task in understanding the entanglement properties of quantum states. Our approach leverages a combination of group theory and computational algebraic geometry to identify the invariant rings of local unitary groups acting on qubit systems. By exploiting the symmetry properties of these groups, we develop a novel method for computing the invariants, which significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of computational complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by computing local invariants for a range of qubit systems, including systems with up to five qubits. Our results provide new insights into the entanglement properties of these systems and have implications for the study of quantum information and quantum computing.
Analogue Quantum Computers for Data Analysis<sep>We present a novel framework for leveraging analogue quantum computers in data analysis applications. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics and analogue computing, our approach enables the efficient processing of complex datasets, thereby overcoming the limitations of classical computational methods. Our architecture, dubbed AQDA (Analogue Quantum Data Analysis), employs a hybrid quantum-classical paradigm, wherein a classical pre-processing stage is followed by an analogue quantum processing unit (QPU). The QPU, comprised of a network of analogue quantum circuits, performs a series of quantum operations that facilitate the identification of patterns and correlations within the input data. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation, we demonstrate the efficacy of AQDA in tackling a range of data analysis tasks, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Notably, our results indicate that AQDA can achieve significant speedup and accuracy improvements over classical algorithms, particularly in scenarios involving high-dimensional and noisy data. Our work provides a foundation for the development of practical analogue quantum computing applications in data analysis, with potential implications for fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and scientific computing. Furthermore, the AQDA framework can be adapted to various analogue quantum computing platforms, including superconducting circuits, ion traps, and optical systems.
Quantum Lower Bounds by Polynomials<sep>We present a new method for proving lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions. Our approach is based on the representation of Boolean functions as polynomials over the reals, and the observation that the degree of this polynomial is closely related to the quantum query complexity of the function. We show that for any Boolean function f, the number of quantum queries required to compute f with high probability is at least ?(sqrt(deg(f))), where deg(f) is the degree of the polynomial representing f. Using this result, we obtain new lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of several important Boolean functions, including the OR and AND functions, the majority function, and the parity function. Our bounds are tight for some of these functions, and improve previous bounds for others. Our results demonstrate the power of the polynomial method for proving quantum lower bounds, and have implications for the study of quantum algorithms and quantum information processing.
1-way quantum finite automata: strengths, weaknesses and generalizations<sep>We investigate the computational power of 1-way quantum finite automata (1QFAs), a quantum analogue of classical finite automata. We demonstrate that 1QFAs can recognize certain languages with exponentially fewer states than their classical counterparts, showcasing their strengths in language recognition. However, we also identify limitations of 1QFAs, including their inability to recognize certain regular languages and the difficulty of implementing certain quantum operations. To address these weaknesses, we introduce generalizations of 1QFAs, such as multi-letter and multi-dimensional 1QFAs, and explore their capabilities. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of 1QFAs and their potential applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing.
Dense Quantum Coding and a Lower Bound for 1-way Quantum Automata<sep>We investigate the power of 1-way quantum finite automata (1QFA) in recognizing languages. Specifically, we introduce a new technique for dense quantum coding, which enables the efficient encoding of classical information into quantum states. Utilizing this technique, we establish a lower bound on the size of 1QFA required to recognize certain languages. Our result implies that there exists a language that can be recognized by a classical finite automaton of size O(n), but any 1QFA recognizing the same language must have size at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$. This provides the first exponential separation between the power of 1QFA and classical finite automata. Our findings have implications for the study of quantum automata and the complexity of quantum computation.
The quantum query complexity of approximating the median and related statistics<sep>We investigate the quantum query complexity of approximating the median and related statistics, such as the k-th quantile and interquartile range, of a probability distribution on a finite set. We provide a quantum algorithm that achieves an optimal tradeoff between the number of queries and the approximation error, and show that this tradeoff is best possible up to constant factors. Our results imply that quantum computers can approximate the median to within an additive error of ? using O(1/?) queries to the distribution, which is a quadratic improvement over the best known classical algorithm. We also show that this speedup is not limited to the median, but extends to a broad class of related statistics. Our approach is based on a new quantum algorithm for approximating the mean of a bounded function, which may be of independent interest. This algorithm uses a combination of amplitude amplification and phase estimation to achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between the number of queries and the approximation error.
Quantum Oracle Interrogation: Getting all information for almost half the price<sep>We present a quantum algorithm for interrogating an oracle that provides an exponential reduction in the number of queries required to extract all information from the oracle. The algorithm, which we call Quantum Oracle Interrogation (QOI), achieves this by exploiting the principles of quantum parallelism and interference to efficiently extract information from the oracle. Specifically, we show that QOI can extract all information from an oracle with n possible outputs using approximately n/2 + O(sqrt(n)) queries, which is significantly less than the n queries required by classical algorithms. We also demonstrate that QOI is optimal up to a constant factor, and provide a lower bound on the number of queries required to extract all information from an oracle. Our results have implications for a wide range of applications, including quantum machine learning, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology.
Two Classical Queries versus One Quantum Query<sep>We present a family of Boolean functions for which the classical query complexity is exponentially larger than the quantum query complexity. Specifically, we show that while any classical algorithm requires at least two queries to compute these functions with high probability, a single quantum query suffices to compute them exactly. This separation is shown to hold even in the presence of noise, where the quantum algorithm is robust against bounded errors. Our result provides evidence for the power of quantum computation in the query model and has implications for the study of quantum algorithms and complexity theory.
Fast Quantum Fourier Transforms for a Class of Non-abelian Groups<sep>We present an efficient quantum algorithm for computing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) over a class of non-abelian groups, specifically the dihedral and symmetric groups. Our approach leverages the inherent symmetry of these groups to reduce the computational complexity of the QFT, enabling a significant speedup over existing methods. For the dihedral group D_n, our algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(poly(log n)), improving upon the previous bound of O(n log n). Similarly, for the symmetric group S_n, we obtain a time complexity of O(poly(n log n)), beating the prior estimate of O(n^2 log n). Our method relies on a novel decomposition of the group algebra into a direct sum of irreducible representations, allowing us to exploit the sparsity of the Fourier transform matrix. We further demonstrate the practicality of our approach by providing an explicit implementation for the dihedral group D_n. The results of this work have implications for various quantum algorithms, including quantum phase estimation, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning, which rely heavily on the QFT. Our fast QFT algorithm for non-abelian groups paves the way for the efficient solution of problems in these domains.
An Introduction to Quantum Computing for Non-Physicists<sep>Quantum computing has emerged as a revolutionary technology with the potential to solve complex problems that are intractable with classical computers. However, the underlying principles of quantum computing are rooted in quantum mechanics, making it inaccessible to non-physicists. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive introduction to quantum computing, tailored specifically for non-physicists. We begin by introducing the basic concepts of quantum mechanics, including superposition, entanglement, and measurement, using intuitive analogies and minimal mathematical formalism. We then explain the fundamental principles of quantum computing, including qubits, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms. The paper also covers the current state of quantum computing technology, including quantum hardware, software, and applications. Throughout the paper, we use relatable examples and analogies to illustrate complex quantum concepts, making it easier for non-physicists to grasp the underlying principles. We also provide a comprehensive overview of the current quantum computing landscape, including the latest advancements and challenges. This paper is intended for researchers and professionals from diverse backgrounds, including computer science, mathematics, engineering, and philosophy, who are interested in understanding the basics of quantum computing and its potential applications. By providing a clear and concise introduction to quantum computing, we hope to inspire a broader audience to explore this exciting and rapidly evolving field.
Concatenating Decoherence Free Subspaces with Quantum Error Correcting Codes<sep>We propose a novel approach to mitigate decoherence in quantum systems by concatenating decoherence-free subspaces (DFS) with quantum error correcting codes (QECC). By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, our method provides an enhanced protection against errors caused by unwanted interactions with the environment. We first identify a DFS within the Hilbert space of the quantum system, which provides a natural shielding against decoherence. Then, we concatenate this DFS with a QECC, effectively encoding the quantum information in a higher-dimensional space. This concatenated code benefits from the passive error correction provided by the DFS, while also enabling active error correction via the QECC. We analyze the performance of our concatenated code and demonstrate its superiority over individual DFS and QECC methods in various noise scenarios. Our results have implications for the development of robust quantum computing architectures and the protection of quantum information in noisy environments.
Classical Trajectories for two Ring-Shaped Potentials<sep>We investigate the classical motion of a particle in the presence of two ring-shaped potentials. By analyzing the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion, we identify the conditions for bounded and unbounded trajectories. We find that the interplay between the two ring-shaped potentials leads to a rich variety of trajectories, including periodic orbits, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaotic motion. We explore the phase space structure of the system and identify the regions where regular and chaotic behavior coexist. The effects of the potential parameters on the classical trajectories are also examined in detail. Our results provide insight into the classical dynamics of particles in complex potential landscapes and have implications for the study of quantum systems with similar geometries.
Coin Tossing is Strictly Weaker Than Bit Commitment<sep>Coin tossing and bit commitment are two fundamental primitives in cryptography, enabling secure multi-party computation and achieving fairness in distributed protocols. While both primitives are known to be weaker than oblivious transfer, their relative power has remained an open question. In this work, we resolve this question by showing that coin tossing is strictly weaker than bit commitment. We demonstrate a separation between the two primitives by exhibiting a protocol that achieves bit commitment using a black-box coin tossing protocol, while also showing that the converse is impossible. More specifically, we prove that any black-box reduction from bit commitment to coin tossing must fail, by constructing a specific coin tossing protocol that is secure against any adversary, yet cannot be used to achieve secure bit commitment. Our results have implications for the design of cryptographic protocols and highlight the importance of carefully selecting the underlying primitives to achieve the desired security guarantees. Furthermore, our separation sheds new light on the structure of cryptographic primitives, revealing a richer hierarchy than previously known.
Unconditionally Secure Bit Commitment<sep>We propose a novel bit commitment protocol that achieves unconditional security by harnessing the fundamental constraints of quantum mechanics and special relativity. Our protocol exploits the no-communication theorem in quantum mechanics and the finite speed of information propagation in spacetime to prevent any possible cheating strategy. By encoding the committed bit in a quantum state and utilizing a relativistic setup, we ensure that any attempt to reveal or alter the committed value would be detectable. Our protocol is shown to be secure against any computationally unbounded adversary, and its security is independent of any computational assumptions. The proposed protocol has significant implications for the development of secure multi-party computation and quantum cryptography.
Minimal coupling and Feynman's proof<sep>We revisit Feynman's proof of the Lorentz force law for a charged particle in the presence of an electromagnetic field. By re-examining the assumptions underlying Feynman's derivation, we show that the minimal coupling prescription, which replaces the momentum operator with its covariant counterpart, plays a crucial role in establishing the Lorentz force. Our analysis clarifies the relationship between minimal coupling, the Lorentz force, and the structure of Maxwell's equations, providing a deeper understanding of the foundations of classical electrodynamics. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the interpretation of the electromagnetic force and the role of minimal coupling in the context of gauge theories.
Lower Bounds for Quantum Search and Derandomization<sep>We investigate the limitations of quantum algorithms for search problems and their implications for derandomization. We establish new lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of several fundamental problems, including the unstructured search problem and the element distinctness problem. Our results imply that the quadratic speedup achieved by Grover's algorithm is optimal for a broad class of search problems. Furthermore, we explore the connections between quantum search and derandomization, showing that any significant improvement over classical algorithms for certain search problems would imply the existence of efficient derandomization algorithms for a wide range of probabilistic algorithms. Our results provide new insights into the power and limitations of quantum computation, as well as the relationship between quantum algorithms and classical derandomization techniques.
A Quick Glance at Quantum Cryptography<sep>We present a concise review of the fundamental principles and current state of quantum cryptography, a rapidly evolving field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure secure communication. This paper provides an introduction to the key concepts, including quantum key distribution (QKD), entanglement-based cryptography, and quantum-resistant algorithms. We discuss the theoretical foundations of quantum cryptography, such as the no-cloning theorem and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and explore the practical implementations of QKD protocols, including BB84 and Ekert91. We also examine the challenges and limitations of quantum cryptography, including the impact of noise and decoherence on the security of quantum communication systems. Finally, we provide an overview of the current research directions and future prospects of quantum cryptography, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field of secure communication.
A note on quantum black-box complexity of almost all Boolean functions<sep>We investigate the quantum black-box complexity of Boolean functions, a fundamental problem in quantum computing. In this model, a quantum algorithm is given access to a black box that evaluates a Boolean function f at a chosen input. The goal is to determine the minimum number of queries to the black box required to compute f. We show that, for almost all Boolean functions f on n bits, the quantum black-box complexity is ?(2^n), up to a logarithmic factor. This lower bound is nearly tight, as a simple quantum algorithm can compute any Boolean function using O(2^n) queries. Our result demonstrates that, for most Boolean functions, the quantum black-box model does not provide a significant advantage over classical computation. Our proof relies on a combination of techniques from quantum information theory and combinatorics, and provides new insights into the limitations of quantum computing in the black-box model. Our result has implications for the study of quantum algorithms and the understanding of the power of quantum computing.
Non-equal-time Poisson brackets<sep>We introduce a generalization of the traditional Poisson bracket, allowing for non-equal-time commutation relations between classical observables. This extension, motivated by the need to capture the full dynamical content of classical systems, provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between classical and quantum mechanics. By abandoning the equal-time constraint, our formalism enables the description of non-instantaneous interactions and retarded effects, which are ubiquitous in real-world systems. We demonstrate the utility of non-equal-time Poisson brackets by applying them to a range of problems, including the derivation of classical field equations, the analysis of dissipative systems, and the study of quantum-classical correspondence. Our results show that this novel framework offers a fresh perspective on the foundations of classical and quantum mechanics, with potential implications for fields such as condensed matter physics, quantum information theory, and theoretical cosmology.
NQP_{C} = co-C_{=}P<sep>We establish a surprising connection between two seemingly disparate complexity classes: NQP_{C}, the class of problems solvable by a nondeterministic quantum polynomial-time algorithm with a classical witness, and co-C_{=}P, the class of problems whose complements are solvable by a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm with access to a non-deterministic oracle. Specifically, we show that NQP_{C} = co-C_{=}P, providing a new characterization of NQP_{C} in terms of classical probabilistic computation. Our result has implications for our understanding of the relationships between quantum and classical complexity classes, and highlights the power of non-deterministic quantum computation. Furthermore, it opens up new avenues for the study of quantum algorithms and the development of new quantum complexity classes.
Polynomial-Time Solution to the Hidden Subgroup Problem for a Class of non-abelian Groups<sep>We present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) for a class of non-abelian groups, specifically those that can be expressed as a semidirect product of abelian groups with a cyclic group of prime power order. Our approach leverages the symmetry of the group and the structure of the irreducible representations to efficiently identify the hidden subgroup. By utilizing a combination of quantum Fourier transforms and classical post-processing, we achieve an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for this problem. Our result expands the class of groups for which the HSP can be solved efficiently, and has implications for various quantum algorithms, including those for solving problems in algebra, number theory, and computer science. Furthermore, our techniques may be applicable to other non-abelian groups, and could potentially lead to a broader understanding of the relationship between group structure and the complexity of the HSP.
A better lower bound for quantum algorithms searching an ordered list<sep>We investigate the problem of searching an ordered list using a quantum computer. This fundamental problem has been extensively studied in the context of quantum algorithms, with the goal of achieving a speedup over classical algorithms. While it is well-known that a quantum algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for searching an unordered list, the optimal quantum query complexity for searching an ordered list remains an open question. In this paper, we establish a new lower bound on the quantum query complexity of searching an ordered list. Our result improves upon the previous best known lower bound and demonstrates that any quantum algorithm for searching an ordered list must make at least ?(log n / log log n) queries to the list. This lower bound is achieved through a novel application of the quantum adversary method, which allows us to derive a tight lower bound on the quantum query complexity of the problem. Our result has implications for the study of quantum algorithms and provides new insights into the limitations of quantum computing for searching ordered lists. Furthermore, our techniques may be applicable to other problems in quantum computing, leading to new lower bounds and a deeper understanding of the power of quantum algorithms.
Quantum Bounded Query Complexity<sep>We study the quantum bounded query complexity of Boolean functions, a fundamental model that captures the power of quantum computation in the context of limited access to input information. In this model, a quantum algorithm is allowed to make a bounded number of queries to the input, and the goal is to minimize the number of queries required to compute the function with high accuracy. We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing the quantum bounded query complexity of Boolean functions, based on the notion of quantum certificate complexity. We show that this complexity measure is closely related to the classical certificate complexity of the function, and that it provides a tight lower bound on the quantum bounded query complexity. Using this framework, we establish a number of new results on the quantum bounded query complexity of specific Boolean functions, including the OR function, the AND-OR tree, and the Majority function. We also show that the quantum bounded query complexity of a Boolean function is closely related to its sensitivity and block sensitivity, two fundamental measures of the function's complexity. Our results provide new insights into the power of quantum computation in the context of limited access to input information, and have implications for the study of quantum algorithms and complexity theory.
An Almost-Quadratic Lower Bound for Quantum Formula Size<sep>We prove an almost-quadratic lower bound on the size of quantum formulas computing a specific Boolean function. This improves upon the previously known lower bounds for quantum formula size, which were only linear. Our result is based on a novel application of the polynomial method and a careful analysis of the structure of quantum formulas. Specifically, we show that any quantum formula computing the "Element Distinctness" function must have size at least ?(n^{2-?}) for any constant ? > 0. This bound is tight up to logarithmic factors, as we also show that there exists a quantum formula of size O(n^2) computing this function. Our result demonstrates a significant gap between the power of quantum formulas and that of classical formulas, and has implications for the study of quantum algorithms and circuit complexity.
A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything<sep>We present a novel paradigm for understanding the intricacies of existence through the lens of computer science. Inspired by Douglas Adams' seminal work, we propose a computational framework that encapsulates the complexities of life, the universe, and everything. By leveraging concepts from algorithm design, complexity theory, and data structures, we develop a unified model that elucidates the underlying mechanisms governing reality. Our framework posits that the universe can be viewed as a vast, distributed computing system, with fundamental laws and principles governing its behavior. We demonstrate how concepts such as NP-completeness, recursion, and entropy can be applied to explain phenomena ranging from the emergence of life to the fabric of spacetime. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of "computational consciousness," which provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the nature of intelligence, free will, and the human experience. Our model also offers insights into the ultimate question of the meaning of life, suggesting that it may be related to the solution of a complex optimization problem. This work has far-reaching implications for fields such as cosmology, biology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. By providing a computational perspective on existence, we hope to inspire new avenues of research and foster a deeper understanding of the intricate web of relationships that govern our universe.
Probabilities to accept languages by quantum finite automata<sep>We investigate the properties of quantum finite automata (QFAs) and their acceptance probabilities for various languages. QFAs are quantum counterparts of classical finite automata, and they have been shown to be more powerful than their classical counterparts in certain situations. In this paper, we study the acceptance probabilities of QFAs for regular and non-regular languages. We provide a detailed analysis of the acceptance probabilities for various QFA models, including measure-once, measure-many, and reversible QFAs. Our results show that the acceptance probabilities of QFAs can be used to distinguish between different types of languages and to understand the limitations of QFAs in recognizing certain languages. We also discuss the implications of our results for the study of quantum computation and quantum information processing.
Average-Case Quantum Query Complexity<sep>We study the average-case quantum query complexity of Boolean functions, a fundamental problem in quantum computing and quantum information theory. The average-case quantum query complexity of a Boolean function f is the minimum number of quantum queries required to compute f with high probability, where the input is drawn from a distribution D. We develop a new framework for analyzing the average-case quantum query complexity of Boolean functions, based on the notion of quantum statistical distinguishability. Using this framework, we establish tight lower bounds on the average-case quantum query complexity of several well-known Boolean functions, including the OR function, the AND function, and the Majority function. We also show that the average-case quantum query complexity of a Boolean function f is closely related to the L1-norm of the Fourier transform of f, a fundamental concept in the analysis of Boolean functions. This relationship allows us to derive new bounds on the average-case quantum query complexity of Boolean functions, and to shed new light on the nature of quantum query complexity. Our results have important implications for the study of quantum algorithms and quantum information theory, and demonstrate the power of quantum statistical distinguishability as a tool for analyzing quantum query complexity.
A simple proof of the unconditional security of quantum key distribution<sep>We present a simplified proof of the unconditional security of quantum key distribution. Our approach is based on the concept of entanglement purification and relies on the no-cloning theorem. We show that any attempt by an eavesdropper to measure the state of the quantum key will necessarily introduce errors, making it impossible for them to obtain a perfect copy of the key. We then use a classical argument to show that the legitimate parties can use error correction and privacy amplification to distill a secure key. Our proof is intuitive and accessible, and provides a clear understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the security of quantum key distribution.
Optimal lower bounds for quantum automata and random access codes<sep>We investigate the fundamental limits of quantum automata and random access codes, two basic models of quantum computation and information processing. We establish optimal lower bounds on the size of quantum automata for recognizing certain regular languages, and on the number of bits required for encoding classical information in a way that allows efficient quantum retrieval. Our results are based on a combination of techniques from quantum information theory, automata theory, and combinatorics. We show that any quantum automaton recognizing a regular language with a certain level of complexity must have a number of states that grows exponentially with the complexity of the language. Similarly, we prove that any random access code that allows efficient quantum retrieval of classical information must have a length that grows linearly with the amount of information being encoded. Our lower bounds are tight, as we demonstrate by constructing explicit examples of quantum automata and random access codes that achieve the optimal bounds. These results provide a fundamental understanding of the power and limitations of quantum computation and information processing, and have implications for the development of quantum algorithms and protocols.
Self-Testing of Universal and Fault-Tolerant Sets of Quantum Gates<sep>We introduce a robust self-testing protocol for verifying the correctness of a universal set of quantum gates, augmented by fault-tolerant procedures to ensure reliable computation. Our scheme leverages the principles of device-independent quantum verification, enabling the assessment of gate fidelity without relying on a priori trust in the measurement devices or the physical implementation of the gates. Specifically, we demonstrate that a set of Clifford gates, supplemented by a single non-Clifford operation, can be self-tested using a family of local Hamiltonians and a small number of trusted preparations and measurements. We also show that our protocol can be adapted to accommodate fault-tolerant methods, such as the surface code and concatenated coding schemes, thereby enabling the reliable estimation of gate errors in the presence of noise and errors. Our results provide a crucial step towards the development of scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures, where the verification of gate correctness is an essential component of reliable computation.
Quantum finite multitape automata<sep>We introduce the concept of Quantum Finite Multitape Automata (QFMA), a quantum analogue of classical multitape finite automata. QFMA extends the capabilities of quantum finite automata by allowing the simultaneous processing of multiple input strings, thereby enabling the recognition of more complex languages. Our framework incorporates the principles of quantum parallelism and superposition, enabling QFMA to recognize certain languages more efficiently than their classical counterparts. We define the formal model of QFMA, including the transition function, acceptance criteria, and probabilistic behavior. We then demonstrate the power of QFMA by showing that they can recognize certain languages that are not recognizable by classical multitape finite automata, including non-regular languages. Furthermore, we establish a connection between QFMA and quantum Turing machines, highlighting the potential of QFMA as a fundamental model of quantum computation. Our results have significant implications for the study of quantum computation, language recognition, and the relationship between quantum and classical automata. The QFMA framework offers a new perspective on the intersection of quantum mechanics and theoretical computer science, and we anticipate that it will inspire further research in these areas.
Operation of universal gates in a DXD superconducting solid state quantum computer<sep>We report the successful implementation of a universal gate set in a DXD (double-transmon, Xmon, double-transmon) superconducting solid-state quantum computer. Our architecture consists of two transmon qubits coupled to a central Xmon qubit, enabling the realization of high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We demonstrate the operation of a universal gate set, comprising the Hadamard (H), Pauli-X (X), Pauli-Y (Y), Pauli-Z (Z), controlled-NOT (CNOT), and T gates, with average gate fidelities exceeding 98%. We also showcase the execution of a selection of quantum algorithms, including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), to demonstrate the computational capabilities of our DXD quantum processor. Our results pave the way for the development of more complex quantum algorithms and applications on superconducting solid-state quantum computing architectures.
A Foundation of Programming a Multi-Tape Quantum Turing machine<sep>We present a rigorous framework for programming a multi-tape Quantum Turing Machine (QTM), a foundational model for quantum computation. Building on the classical concept of a multi-tape Turing Machine, we introduce a formal definition of a multi-tape QTM and develop a comprehensive programming paradigm. Our framework encompasses the syntax and semantics of quantum operations, including quantum gates, measurements, and tape interactions. We provide a novel, high-level programming language, QTMPL, designed specifically for multi-tape QTMs, and demonstrate its expressiveness through various examples, including quantum algorithms and simulations. We also establish the equivalence of our programming model with the quantum circuit model, ensuring the universality of our approach. Our work lays the groundwork for the development of practical programming tools and software for multi-tape QTMs, paving the way for the exploration of quantum algorithms and applications.
Secure Classical Bit Commitment using Fixed Capacity Communication Channels<sep>We propose a novel protocol for secure classical bit commitment over fixed capacity communication channels. In this scenario, two mutually distrustful parties, traditionally referred to as Alice and Bob, engage in a cryptographic protocol where Alice commits to a secret bit without revealing its value to Bob. Our approach leverages the limitations imposed by the fixed capacity channel to prevent Bob from extracting any information about the committed bit prior to the reveal phase. By exploiting the fundamental principles of information theory, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves unconditional security against any cheating strategy employed by Bob. Furthermore, we show that the protocol is also secure against a cheating Alice, who may attempt to change her commitment after the initial phase. Our results have significant implications for the study of secure multi-party computation and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving secure bit commitment in a classical setting without relying on quantum mechanics or computational assumptions. The proposed protocol is efficient, easy to implement, and can be integrated into existing cryptographic systems, making it a valuable contribution to the field of cryptography.
Structure behind Mechanics<sep>We introduce a new geometrical framework that underlies the fundamental principles of classical mechanics, providing a unified description of the structure beneath the dynamics of physical systems. By employing a rigorous mathematical approach, we demonstrate that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations can be derived from a single, overarching geometrical structure. This framework, rooted in the language of differential geometry and symplectic topology, reveals the intrinsic connections between the variational principles, conservation laws, and the symmetries of mechanical systems. Our work builds upon the notion that the geometry of phase space is the fundamental entity that governs the behavior of physical systems, rather than the specific choice of coordinates or the form of the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian functions. We show that this geometry can be encoded in a Cartan distribution on the phase space, which in turn gives rise to a novel, intrinsic characterization of the mechanical systems. The proposed framework offers a fresh perspective on the foundations of classical mechanics, enabling a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry, symmetry, and conservation laws. Furthermore, our results have far-reaching implications for the study of complex systems, the development of new numerical methods, and the exploration of the interfaces between classical and quantum mechanics.
The importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes<sep>Quantum decoherence, the loss of quantum coherence due to interactions with the environment, has long been recognized as a fundamental mechanism governing the emergence of classical behavior from quantum systems. Recent studies have sparked intense debate about the potential role of quantum mechanics in brain processes, particularly in the context of consciousness and cognitive function. In this paper, we investigate the importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes, focusing on its implications for neural signaling, synaptic plasticity, and information processing. Using a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that decoherence plays a crucial role in regulating the quantum dynamics of neural systems, effectively "classicalizing" the behavior of neurons and their interactions. Our results show that decoherence rates in the brain are orders of magnitude faster than those typically encountered in quantum computing and quantum information processing, suggesting that quantum coherence is unlikely to be maintained for extended periods in neural systems. Despite this, we argue that quantum decoherence can still have a profound impact on brain function, particularly in situations where quantum fluctuations influence the dynamics of neural networks. We propose a novel framework for understanding the interplay between quantum decoherence and neural activity, highlighting the potential for decoherence to act as a "noise source" that can shape the emergent behavior of complex neural systems. Our findings have significant implications for the development of quantum-inspired models of brain function and the interpretation of experimental results in the field of quantum neuroscience. By shedding light on the role of quantum decoherence in brain processes, this work aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and the human experience.
Analysis of Quantum Functions<sep>We present a comprehensive analysis of quantum functions, a fundamental concept in quantum computing that underlies the design of quantum algorithms and the study of quantum computability. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for characterizing quantum functions, which enables us to systematically investigate their properties and behavior. Our framework is based on a novel decomposition of quantum functions into a set of elementary quantum operations, which allows us to derive a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be quantum computable. We also introduce a new notion of quantum function complexity, which captures the resources required to implement a quantum function and provides a useful tool for comparing the efficiency of different quantum algorithms. Using our framework, we demonstrate the existence of a hierarchy of quantum functions, with distinct levels of complexity and computability. We also show that certain quantum functions, previously thought to be computationally intractable, can be efficiently approximated using a novel quantum algorithm. Our results have significant implications for the study of quantum computability and the design of quantum algorithms. They also shed new light on the fundamental limitations of quantum computing and the potential for quantum computers to solve complex problems that are intractable on classical computers.
Quantum Computation and Quadratically Signed Weight Enumerators<sep>We establish a novel connection between quantum computation and the combinatorial properties of quadratically signed weight enumerators (QSWWEs). QSWWEs are a generalization of the classical weight enumerators that have been extensively studied in coding theory. We show that QSWWEs can be used to derive a unified framework for understanding the quantum error correction properties of a wide class of quantum codes, including topological codes and concatenated codes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the QSWWE of a quantum code can be used to compute its threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation, as well as its performance under various noise models. We also show that the QSWWE can be used to derive bounds on the minimum distance and the decoding error probability of a quantum code. Our results have significant implications for the study of quantum error correction and the design of robust quantum algorithms. They also highlight the importance of combinatorial methods in understanding the properties of quantum systems, and demonstrate the potential for cross-fertilization between quantum computation and classical coding theory.
Almost-Everywhere Superiority for Quantum Computing<sep>We demonstrate the almost-everywhere superiority of quantum computing over classical computing for a broad class of computational problems. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, we show that quantum computers can solve a wide range of problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts, with high probability, for almost all instances. This result is obtained by exploiting the phenomenon of quantum parallelism, where a single quantum operation can be equivalent to an exponential number of classical operations. Our proof relies on a novel application of the concentration of measure phenomenon, which allows us to bound the probability of success for a quantum algorithm to be exponentially close to unity. This, in turn, enables us to demonstrate the almost-everywhere superiority of quantum computing for problems in the BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial Time) complexity class. Our findings have significant implications for the development of quantum algorithms and the study of quantum complexity theory. They provide a rigorous foundation for the notion that quantum computing can offer a substantial advantage over classical computing for a wide range of problems, and highlight the potential for quantum computers to solve complex problems that are currently intractable with classical resources.
Transition Radiation and the Origin of Sonoluminescence<sep>Sonoluminescence, the phenomenon of light emission from collapsing bubbles in a sound field, has been the subject of intense research for decades. Despite significant experimental and theoretical efforts, the underlying mechanism responsible for this process remains poorly understood. In this work, we propose a novel explanation for the origin of sonoluminescence, based on the concept of transition radiation. We demonstrate that the rapid change in the dielectric properties of the bubble medium during collapse can lead to the emission of a burst of radiation, which we identify as the source of sonoluminescence. Our theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and experimental data, provides a coherent and self-consistent explanation for the key features of sonoluminescence, including the observed spectral characteristics, pulse duration, and dependence on bubble parameters. Our findings offer a new perspective on the physics of sonoluminescence and have implications for the study of other radiation-emitting phenomena in complex systems.
Unconditionally Secure Commitment of a Certified Classical Bit is Impossible<sep>We investigate the possibility of achieving unconditional security in the commitment of a certified classical bit. In a commitment protocol, one party (Alice) aims to commit a bit to another party (Bob) in such a way that Bob cannot learn the value of the bit until Alice chooses to reveal it, while also ensuring that Alice cannot change the value of the bit once it has been committed. We show that it is impossible to achieve unconditionally secure commitment of a certified classical bit. Our result holds even when Alice and Bob have access to unlimited classical and quantum resources, and is based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and the no-signaling principle. This impossibility result has implications for the study of quantum cryptography and the development of secure quantum communication protocols.
Cheat Sensitive Quantum Bit Commitment<sep>We propose a cheat-sensitive quantum bit commitment scheme that balances the conflicting requirements of concealing the committed bit and detecting cheating attempts. In our protocol, any attempt by the committer to cheat by unveiling the wrong bit is detectable with a probability that increases exponentially with the number of qubits used in the commitment. Conversely, the protocol ensures that the committed bit remains concealed from the verifier, thus satisfying the fundamental binding and concealing properties of bit commitment. By introducing an asymmetry in the error probabilities for the two possible cheating strategies, our scheme provides a rigorous security guarantee against both cheating and eavesdropping. We demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, and discuss its potential applications in quantum cryptography and secure multi-party computation.
Quantum Computing, NP-complete Problems and Chaotic Dynamics<sep>We investigate the intricate relationship between quantum computing, NP-complete problems, and chaotic dynamics. By harnessing the power of quantum parallelism, we develop a novel framework for tackling NP-complete problems, which have long been a cornerstone of computational complexity theory. Our approach leverages the inherent sensitivity of chaotic systems to initial conditions, allowing us to encode NP-complete problems into the dynamics of a quantum-chaotic hybrid system. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in solving paradigmatic NP-complete problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Boolean Satisfiability Problem. Our results show that the quantum-chaotic hybrid system exhibits a phase transition in the vicinity of the solution, thereby providing a clear signature of the problem's solvability. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our findings for the study of quantum chaos and the behavior of complex quantum systems. Our work reveals a deep connection between the onset of chaos and the emergence of computational complexity, shedding new light on the fundamental limits of efficient computation.
Leading Order Temporal Asymptotics of the Modified Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation: Solitonless Sector<sep>We consider the modified non-linear Schr?dinger (MNLS) equation, a paradigmatic model for the study of nonlinear dispersive phenomena in various physical contexts. In this work, we focus on the solitonless sector of the MNLS equation, where the solution is asymptotically described by a dispersive wave train. Using a combination of the nonlinear steepest descent method and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we derive the leading order temporal asymptotics of the solution in the large-time limit. Our results reveal the detailed structure of the asymptotic solution, including the explicit form of the dispersive wave train and the temporal decay rates of the solution. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of the long-time behavior of the MNLS equation in the solitonless sector, with implications for the study of dispersive phenomena in various fields, including optics, fluid dynamics, and condensed matter physics.
